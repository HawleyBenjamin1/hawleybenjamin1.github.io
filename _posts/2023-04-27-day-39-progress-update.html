<p>I got back into the swing of things on Oneiromancer this week. I've been trying to keep the word count up, but progress always feels so slow. I'm getting to a more exciting part in the story soon so hopefully that will make me feel like the pace is going a bit faster. Last week I wasn't able to focus on it as much so this week I spent a lot of time just trying to recapture the right mood. It may be impossible, but I'd like to avoid taking a longer break on a work in progress. Obviously it makes it harder to remember what you were doing, but it also just feels bad getting back to a document and seeing no edits since last week.</p>

<p>I have another book haul that I'm going to cover tomorrow, and I'll probably try to slip in more about the Mark Twain stories because they're so good. Other than that, there's not much for this update. There is something I've been wanting to do with the blog for a while, so come Monday I'm going to try it out. It's been more than a month in the making now and I want to do a retrospective on some earlier posts to analyze my thought process and see if I've learned anything since. Whether I was totally wrong back then or totally right doesn't really matter as long as I can get a good takeaway.</p>

<p>I'm gonna make today's post a pretty short one because I just don't have the much on my mind right now. Tomorrow's post should be a fun one though, so I'll talk to you then!</p>
