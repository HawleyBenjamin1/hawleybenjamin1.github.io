<p>Reading Crichton is so fulfilling because it feels like every page I learn something new. He's able to link so many diverse topics, locations, people, and events together so seamlessly, building the story with every sentence. A cop from a sleepy town in New Mexico, a popular professor of archeology excavating a site in Dordogne France, and a billionaire physicist with grand dreams. Linked together by the ITC corporation, each of these players are involved in a growing mystery, the secret research of the corp that proves to have deadly consequences for some of its employees. I haven't read very far, but it's really amazing to me how much he can get across in just a couple of chapters. I haven't even gotten to the time travel yet, and it's still a gripping novel. The way he makes suspense just drip from every page is so good, and I wish I could do it half as well as he can. I'm excited to keep reading this one, and I think I'll have to add a few more Crichton books to the list just to figure out how he does it. </p>
