<p>For some reason my coffee was much harsher than usual this morning and it made me make bad decisions. Yes, I put milk in the coffee. Sacrilege, I know. The worst part? It didn't even mar the flavor that much. Now I have no leg to stand on when making fun of people who don't like black coffee. I may as well just drink a milkshake in the morning now. </p>
