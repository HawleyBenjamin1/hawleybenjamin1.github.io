<p>This week I hit a bump in the road and didn't accomplish much. Everything felt like a slog for some reason. It happens from time to time no matter what I do it seems. I did a lot of reading instead to get inspired, and had a few ideas that I can add to 'Oneiromancer' which should help me get back in the mood sooner than later. </p>

<p>Tomorrow I'll have my review of 'Us Against You' ready. I'm not sure I like it quite as much as 'Beartown,' but more on that tomorrow. </p>

<p>Finally, the 'Book of Choices' anthology should be available for purchase tomorrow. I'll post a link when I see it open up, probably alongside the review. I was going to link to the publisher's website but I still haven't seen them update the page for it it'll probably be an amazon link instead. I'm excited to get my hands on it!</p>
