<p>Sorry for the late post everyone, I had a long day today. I did get an unexpected surprise though, something I'd ordered a long time ago but forgotten about from a competition that I didn't get any traction in. It's a little anthology of short stories, and I can see why I didn't make it. All the ones I've read are absolutely amazing. I'll definitely have to step my game up if I ever want to get published by Boulevard Magazine. I'll have a more in depth review tomorrow. Until then, have a good night!</p>
