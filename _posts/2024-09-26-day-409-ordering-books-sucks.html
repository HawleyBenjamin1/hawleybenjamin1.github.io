<p>Well, I promised a first impressions today, but the books arrived so late I don't have much of an impression at all yet. I decided to start with 'Jane Eyre' because I'm considering returning it and if they want it back I'll at least get a head start with this copy. There's a fat gouge in the cover even though I ordered it new, and I know for a fact it wasn't me because the center seam of the box I cut into didn't even cover the book at all. I'm really annoyed with ordering books online these days. I'd like to buy in brick and mortar, but the problem is that I just can't find all the books I want in used stores, and stores that sell books new are so much more expensive! I'm caught between a rock and a hard place and there doesn't seem to be a very good solution. </p>

<p>Anyway, from what little I read of 'Jane Eyre' I already enjoy the style. It starts out with one of the most melancholy descriptions of a rainy day, and goes straight into complaining about life. It's been raining all day here too and if you've read the blog you know how it makes me feel. It's funny how closely art reflects life sometimes. Beyond that, I don't have much else to say about it. Not much has really happened yet, but I assume that will change, or maybe that's just a romance thing, I don't know. At least I'm learning!</p>
