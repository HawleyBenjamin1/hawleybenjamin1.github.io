<p>That question in the title is probably one of the oldest shared questions we have as a species. We've been watching the sky for thousands of years, searching for meaning in the movement of celestial bodies, wondering when the Sun will next be consumed by darkness in the middle of the day. We've long associated these events with spiritual omens and religious rituals, and it's really no wonder why if you've ever seen one. Surreal silence falls over the birds, the crickets are tricked into chirping, the trees cast crescent shaped shadows, and a weird anticipation seems to fall over the land. The light of day slowly fades to darkness as night falls unexpectedly. As if the Sun has suddenly gone out. It's like a reminder that the Sun is an important piece of our little circle of life here on Earth, and without it the natural world would fall into disarray. If it went away for too long, plants would cease to grow, the cold would become unbearable, and we'd be forced to live in perpetual darkness. Then some genius suggests that it would be best to go ahead and sacrifice some sinners now ...</p>

<p>Which is why it feels a tiny bit reductive to sum it up with 'it'll happen around 3PM in the eastern U.S., and don't forget the glasses that will keep you from being blinded by the giant fusion ball in the sky being eclipsed by that big rock up there.' Thankfully, no sacrifices will be necessary. The Moon will cast its shadow regardless of how many people are burned at the stake. You might even be able to see it from space if someone catches a similar video to this one:</p>
