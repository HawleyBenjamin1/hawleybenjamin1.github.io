<p>I have great news! I finally finished the first draft of my novel today! After writing like 4000 words in a day, I finally finished it off in one big burst. It feels really weird to be honest. More of a relief than anything. Not finishing even a first draft would have been a huge letdown, so at least that possibility is gone. I have a couple of holes to fill in during editing, and a bunch of stuff to rewrite cause I know it's gonna hurt to read it back, but yay! I did a thing! I even kinda like the ending I wrote, and wrapped up more than I thought I would be able to with some last minute inspiration. I can't wait to let it sit around for a couple of months while I do something else, lol.</p>

<p>Huge thanks to all the people who've followed the blog all this time, it's been a big help in keeping me on track (even if I did finish four and a half months later than I wanted to, but you didn't hear that from me). I'm sure it would have taken a lot longer without anybody to report back to, warm up with, or give exciting news like this to. </p>

<p>So, quick update on the plans for the blog now that I've got my gushing out of the way. Turns out the additional features I was after as mentioned in my last post are actually locked behind a payment that is triple the WordPress premium package that I thought gave me the features that I wanted ... so that's not happening right at this moment. Of course I'm still going to keep up with the blog, but I decided that if there's only one feature I was going to actually use, then the rest of the payment would be going to little or nothing else. If I do more research and find that I will benefit from all the other features, I might still go for it, but for now the blog will remain the same.</p>
