<p>I bought a bunch of books! If you've been keeping up with the blog, you know I've been reading a bunch of classics for the past few months, and while that has been fun, I decided to go a little more modern this time. That being said, I think all of these are still considered classics, but I'm not sure they have the same vibe as the older classics I've been reading. When I think of 'classics' I have a picture in my mind of a book that looks like it's been around for a century or more, written for people who are already underground (not that that's necessarily a bad thing, ok?), but the books I picked this time are for a slightly more modern audience. There are at least people who can say that they read the book when it came out anyway. With no further ado, let's have a look at the line up!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>'The Forever War' by Joe Haldeman. I actually bought this book quite some time ago, but I had just finished up another sci-fi war novel and couldn't stomach another one. I'm still not too keen on it if I'm being honest, but I can't just leave a book lying around unread. I'm certain it will be good if I just get over the hump of reading yet another novel about fighting aliens. This book won three major awards when it came out in 1975, the Nebula, the Hugo, and the Locus. It takes a solemn look at war through the lens of an interstellar conflict with aliens called the Taurans. Haldeman was a Vietnam veteran and I think his perspective on war will be quite interesting to compare with the next author that I've already read once ... </p>

<p>'A Moveable Feast' by Ernest Hemingway. Yes, I'm reading another Hemingway, though this one is not about war. This is a memoir about Hemingway's life as a young writer and journalist living in Paris during the 1920s. I chose this one because it's relevant to my own current situation and I'm hoping I'll find some wisdom within. This book was actually published posthumously though. Hopefully it won't be <em>that </em>depressing. I'd hate to spare no expense on this book and regret it like a certain character in the next book ...</p>

<p>'Jurassic Park' by Michael Crichton. Another modern classic, this book has got to be the most famous on the list, and it's not even close. The movie is one of my favorites, right up there with Star Wars and Indiana Jones, so I can't not love the book too, right? I think I already know what to expect with this one, since there's nothing like a classic tale of hubris making a mess of everything, but I'm excited to read it nonetheless. I hope it lives up to expectations just as much as this next book ...</p>

<p>'Beloved' by Toni Morrison. I've heard so many authors talk about how much Toni Morrison inspired them that I couldn't ignore the author any longer. I've never read any of her books myself, but the hype behind this one will be difficult to live up to. Set in the post civil war era, it tells the story of a group of former slaves whose dysfunctional family is haunted by a malevolent spirit. I'm excited to read this one because I've heard so much about Toni Morrison, but to be frank, the subject matter sounds rather dreary. I hope I'm up for this one because every review I've read says it's amazing, and it won a Pulitzer, so by reading this I might just find out I have bad taste. </p>

<p>Well, that's only four books. Kind of a small haul, and the reason being is, I couldn't find another to suit the modern classics theme really well. By the time I finish the first one I'm sure I'll have found a good addition to the list. Until then, four books is enough to keep me reading for at least a couple weeks, probably longer. Keep an eye out for reviews coming soon, and have a good Monday.</p>
