<p>I keep saying I want to learn from these posts, so now that I’ve been blogging for a few months I thought it best to write a retrospective. Previous posts have included thoughts on conflict and how it relates to other topics, book reviews, and various other topics on writing. It interests me to see if my original thoughts line up with what I’ve learned since. Identifying any incongruencies is the goal. Thing is, I don't think I have a very good process in place for this yet, but rather than wing it, I'd rather come up with a plan. That's what this post is going to detail.</p>

<p>First off, I'm going to read through my first 10 or so posts and pick the most relevant to cover in the retrospective. Then I'm going to take the same approach I usually do for editing, that being looking for any grammatical errors, phrasing issues, and finally overall content. From there, I will write a few thoughts on my overall opinion of the piece, the faults I find in it, and how I think I might fix those faults or at least avoid them in the future. If anything else occurs to me while I'm 'editing' I'll be sure to add that step of the process to the next post. </p>

<p>I'll probably have one post ready tomorrow and then maybe I can do this as a weekly or bi weekly deal. I think it will really help me improve and that's the whole point of the blog, so I'm happy with the plan so far. I think I already know which post I want to focus on, but I'll save that for tomorrow.</p>
