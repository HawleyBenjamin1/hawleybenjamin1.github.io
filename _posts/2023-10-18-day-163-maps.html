<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I was considering drawing a map of one of the main locations in Oneiromancer after reading several fantasy authors' opinion on drawing maps. They all seem to love doing it, so maybe I'd have some fun with it too. I can see the layout in my head, but I'm sure that just like writing the story I'd have to flesh it out quite a bit to get it down. I'll see what I can do and throw something up tomorrow if anybody is interested in having a look. </p>
