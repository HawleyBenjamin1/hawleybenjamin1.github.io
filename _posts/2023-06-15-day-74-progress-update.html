<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I got carried away this morning and forgot to edit the post I had written for today, so here's a progress update instead. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I've added another chapter to Oneiromancer, plus I have most of another chapter written that I'm not sure what direction I want to take yet. I'm at a pivotal moment in the book and it makes for slow progress because I have written and rewritten the same thing a few times already. Hopefully I'll end up writing this scene in a way that hits the spot soon and I can move forward because I'm tired of being stuck. </p>

<p>Hope everybody has a good Thursday!</p>
