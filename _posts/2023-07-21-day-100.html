<p>I made it to day 100! It feels like not that long ago I was writing the very first post, wondering just what this blog would be about, or how long it would even last. I almost can't believe it. I think now that I've made it to 100 the blog will last as long as I can write, and as long as I have an internet connection. Thank you to everyone who's shown me support over the last few months, including all friends and family. I'm certain the blog would have petered out a long time ago if nobody was there to read it. I really appreciate it, and I've been seeing some more comments lately too, so that has been very encouraging as well. Here's to another 100 days!</p>

<p>I wanted to do something a little different today to mark the occasion, so I decided I would publish the first chapter of Oneiromancer for the world to see. Consider it a teaser if you will, for the real novel which is yet to come. I still plan on completing the first draft by the end of Summer, and I hope to have it edited by the time Winter comes around. Then I can try my hand at publishing, which I've heard is the hard part. Based on my struggles to publish any of my shorter works, I know that's probably going to be doubly true for a full length novel. I'm not sure I even want to think about that right now though, seeing as writing the novel is nowhere close to easy to begin with. I'm going to upload this first chapter sometime in the next couple of hours. I'll give it one last editing pass, but just to be clear, I'll probably edit it pretty extensively again in the future. There's a lot that changes between starting a novel and ending it. Hopefully this first chapter is a reward for subscribing instead of something that makes you regret it!</p>
