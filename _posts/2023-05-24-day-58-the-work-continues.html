<p>Well, I feel a little better today, so I guess I have no excuses. I spent the morning working on a longer post that isn't ready yet, and after this I'm going to spend some time on the main project. There's not much else to report, but I did start reading 'Dracula' after I finished 'For Whom the Bell Tolls.' I'll have a review for that one in a week or two, and you can expect a two part post tomorrow and Friday (the post I was working on earlier). That's about it for today. Hope everybody has a good afternoon.</p>
