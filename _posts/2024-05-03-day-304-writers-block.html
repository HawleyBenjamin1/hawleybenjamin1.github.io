<p>Today's one of those annoying days where I can't come up with anything. Still not sure why this happens. Usually this blog is either a warm up that I edit later, or sometimes I write it later in the day if I had something I really wanted to get out, but today it's looking like about the only thing I'll get done. I think I'll call it a day after this and go do something else to take my mind off of it. </p>

<p>This only happens every once in a while to me but there are some authors who always suffered from recurrent writer's block. Perhaps the most famous was F Scott Fitzgerald, author of 'The Great Gatsby.' His was so bad that after the commercial failure of Gatsby he descended into alcoholism and never wrote anything again. I don't think mine will ever be <em>that </em>bad, but I can certainly empathize with the frustration. Thankfully for Fitzgerald, Gatsby went on to become one of the quintessential American novels long after his death. I guess the silver lining is, even if you do become an alcoholic and a complete commercial failure, at least there's always the chance you become a literary hero. </p>
