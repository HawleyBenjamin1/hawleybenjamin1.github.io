<p>I've just been charged a convenience fee, of zero(!) dollars, to pay my power bill. I'm not sure if that's just a passive aggressive tactic to remind that they could or what, but it's given me an idea.</p>

<p>I will now be charging a viewing fee of zero dollars on all blog posts. While I can't say I'm paid well, it's now an undeniable fact that I charge all my readers for my work on a daily basis. I'm sure this will look good on a resume.</p>
