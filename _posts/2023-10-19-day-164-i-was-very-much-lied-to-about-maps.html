<p>People said this was fun. I don't understand. I've been struggling to put a straight line on a piece of paper for like two hours and absolutely despise the idea of ever drawing a map again. My visual art skills have been in decline since grade school, but holy crap I can barely string two rooms together here. Architecture was never in the cards for me apparently. I'll happily leave my little world a disconnected mess of hallways and rooms in my head if it means I won't have to put pen to paper again, thank you very much. </p>

<p>I even tried putting a description into an image generator to see if it would give me anything resembling what I wanted and it couldn't do it. I was after something like this image I found on pinterest:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":1467,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2023/10/image-2.png?w=483" alt="" class="wp-image-1467" /></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>What I need it to have is a central courtyard though. That's absolutely necessary for the story. It would have the courtyard in the middle, rooms all around, and a restaurant area in one corner. This is obviously just one floor though. Multiple floors is the part that tripped me up while trying to draw this and I'm not sure how anybody could ever depict a multi-story building in a single map. I don't think it's really possible now that I'm thinking about it. </p>

<p>Experiment failed, but at least I learned something along the way. It did help me organize the area a little better, so maybe I should keep this in mind if I need to layout a new area at some point.</p>
