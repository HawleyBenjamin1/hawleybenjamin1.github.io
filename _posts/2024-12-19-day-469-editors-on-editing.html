<p>I finally got a good start on this book and man it has already been worth it. They really come out swinging from the first essay about what it even is to be an editor in the first place. Then it swings right into the evolution of the American editor, letters to would-be editors, the necessity (or sometimes lack thereof) and I haven't even gotten to the real meat of the issue like 'what editors look for in a manuscript' or 'editing crime fiction.' This book is certainly a gold mine and I plan on reading an essay a night for a long time. I think it's best consumed in moderation, with plenty of time in between to let the information marinate. There's not much else I can say about this book, seeing as all the editors have already said it. </p>

<p>I'm happy to say that the last several books I've purchased have all been more than worthwhile. With Christmas coming up, I suppose I'll be having another book haul soon too! I can only hope the streak of great literature continues. </p>
