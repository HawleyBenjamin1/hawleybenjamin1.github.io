<p>Well it's 2024 and somehow that sounds like the future to me. I figured we'd have some cybernetic limbs or something to go along with the encroaching dystopian hellscape by now. When I was a kid I thought I'd be able to get tickets to visit space. My expectations are lower and I still didn't get what I wanted! Thinking about the future back then was a lot of fun. I remember the first time I ever noticed the date change when I went to my kindergarten class as usual, but my teacher made a big deal about changing the number on the board from 2003 to 2004. It made me feel weird because I thought, hey, 2000 is such a big number, but I don't remember any of those previous years. Where'd they all go? Now in 2024 I'm kinda wondering the same thing about the last 20. Funny how that happens.</p>

<p>I don't really do resolutions for New Year's. I have this theory that the reason so many resolutions fail is because if it was a change you really needed to make you'd just make it regardless of what the calendar tells you. For the sake of the holiday spirit though, I think I'll do a small one. Here it goes:</p>

<p>This year I'm definitely going to eat more vegetables. </p>

<p>I eat plenty of vegetables. That actually might be pretty difficult to squeeze even more in, now that I think about it. Damn, see what I mean?</p>
