<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It has been so cold where I am the past few days and I'm starting to go a little stir crazy hiding inside. The roads have been thoroughly salted, so I felt safe enough to drive out and get some groceries today, but man it's still unpleasant out there. The cold seeps into my room through my window to settle on my brain like a thick blanket and my writing turns to soupy fragmented thoughts that don't make much sense. That's why today I'm writing a cop-out post about how I hate the cold. The snow looks pretty, but I'll still be happier when Spring comes around and I can enjoy some sunshine without having my fingers and toes go numb.</p>
