<p>I've noticed while editing that my preferred chapter length is a lot smaller than most of these chapters I've actually written. I've actually ended up splitting them into multiple smaller chapters to maintain a sense of suspense between them. Somehow a short break makes the story seem to progress more smoothly, which is a little counter intuitive. I guess it must be for the same reason that reading a large piece of text is easier when split into paragraphs than a giant wall of text. Maybe the more bite-sized chunks are easier to put into individual groups of memories than a huge, unending series of words. I've even split chapters from one sentence to the next, letting the story just continue without any gap whatsoever except for the chapter ending and the next one beginning, and it feels much better to read. Strange how that works.</p>
