<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm having a slow day today, on top of a slow week. There aren't many forthcoming ideas for Oneiromancer, but I did finish editing a short story this morning, so at least I got something done. Hopefully I get my brain back into to high gear tomorrow because I am tired of struggling to get into a good flow. I just have two main parts left to finish for Oneiromancer, and then I can start editing. It's so close I can taste it but that just seems to make it harder to keep going. Now before I start whining too hard I'm going to go work on it.</p>
