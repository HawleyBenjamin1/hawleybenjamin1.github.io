<p>Slow day today. First time in a while where I just couldn't seem to get anything down. Usually I'll get at least a few hundred words, but there was just nothing coming down the pipe. I'm too distracted.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm not sure what to do with 'Jeffries.' All the advice I've gotten from anybody in the industry has been to turn it into a full-length novel and it'll make it way, way more likely to get published. I don't know if I've got it in me to more than double the word count and edit everything over again though. I've been procrastinating a little with the short stories I've been working on while trying to decide, not that they're worthless, but I am running out of time to make this whole thing work. The writer I had a meeting with last week from the writing conference even told me I was really close to publishing 'Jeffries' and he thought the writing quality was there, if only it were a book and not a novella. It's hard to say no to that kind of feedback, and now I'm stuck feeling like anything else I work on right now is a waste of time even though I'm still waiting to hear back from a few agents about it in the current novella state. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. </p>

<p>Not to whine or anything (ok, maybe a little, or a lot), but it feels really weird to regret receiving what normally would be great feedback. Maybe I should have just planned for it to be a novel in the first place. </p>
