<p>Well its officially been a year since I quit my job and started on this writing journey. Maybe I should have named my blog posts such that the day would be day 365 when it came to a year. Oh well. I can still look forward to day 365 as the 'year's worth of posts' landmark. </p>

<p>I've learned a lot in the past year but I haven't gotten any stories published. That is a little disappointing I have to admit, so I'm hoping to change that this year. I did publish a poem but I'm sure I'll be much more excited to publish a real story in a real magazine. Until then I'll just have to keep trying. I have a few stories I've completed in the past few months, so I'm almost ready to send out the next batch. Hopefully one of these will get some traction and I can kick off my second year of writing with a bang.</p>
