<p>Happy Friday everyone. This past week I've spent more time on the blog than usual with the three parter on twists. Besides the blog, I completed the 100 word story competition and submitted that last weekend. I've also created a big file on changes I want to make to 'Jeffries.' There are a couple of scenes I want to add, and some other revisions I need to complete. It is taking a terribly long time, but I think I should be able to finally finish it off over the next month or so. After that, I'll need to move on for the sake of my sanity. Taking so long on projects really kills my motivation in the long run. I think I want to work on some shorter projects in the near future. I'm not sure what to do about 'Oneiromancer.' Every time I open the file I'm just completely overwhelmed with all that needs rewriting. </p>
