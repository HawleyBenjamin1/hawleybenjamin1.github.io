<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I went for a long hike today over some rocky terrain with my family. It didn't feel like very long, but by the time we finished up the hike it'd been almost an hour an a half. Funny how time flies when you're in motion like that. Sometimes I can achieve something similar when I'm writing and get into a flow state, but it hasn't happened much lately. Editing doesn't tickle my brain the same way getting into the groove of writing does apparently. It requires a lot more thought and analysis than just putting a scene on a page as it comes to me. I think over time I can get to a point where the editing flows as well as the writing does, but man it's taking a while. </p>
