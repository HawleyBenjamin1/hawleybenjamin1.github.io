<p>Hope everybody is having a good Friday afternoon. I'm going to finish off For Whom the Bell Tolls today and write up a review for Monday's post (besides the usual writing) so I've got today all lined up. I'm excited to finish it up, and without giving away too many spoilers, I think its my favorite classic book so far. It is remarkably easy to read, even compared to Frankenstein which was pretty straightforward. I wasn't expecting as much of a focus on the romance as this book has but it fits surprisingly well in the context of the rest of the plot. I hope the ending is as good as the rest.</p>
