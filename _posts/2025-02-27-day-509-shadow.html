<p>There's this Chinese movie I go back and watch again every once in a while called 'Shadow' that always hits just right. It's got a little bit of everything, being part period film, part fantasy, part espionage thriller, and probably like three part Kung Fu movie on top off all that. It's got some really artistic and creative action sequences, and some great effects too, but where I think it really shines is the twisty plot and excellent character building. I find a little something new in every rewatch, putting it in that rare category of movies I'm not sure I'll ever stop seeing again. </p>

<p>The story begins years ago, in the aftermath of the kingdom of Pei's losing war against the kingdom of Yang. The important city of Jingzhou was lost after their genius Commander Ziyu was mortally wounded in combat by Yang Cang, and in the time since, Ziyu has been planning his revenge from deep within a secret chamber of the royal palace. To that end, he directs his shadow, a body double, to challenge Yang Cang to single combat. This angers the crafty, but young and undisciplined King, who demands that Ziyu's double play a duet with the Commader's wife for him in recompense. His refusal to do so sets the plot in motion as the King begins to suspect that Ziyu's body double is not the real Commander ...</p>

<p>There's a lot going on even from the very beginning, and the plot never stops getting thicker. There's some question as to whether the Commander's wife will far for his double, and the King's sister becomes a pawn in his plans, and the Yangs have their own role to play in all of this. Oh and the coolest part of the whole movie are the razor blade umbrellas that the protagonist learns to wield in order to defeat Yang. I mean just look at these things.</p>

<p>The acting and the insane action and crazy twists do get a little ridiculous at times, but they never over stay their welcome so much that it's not still cool. Like here, the secret army that the Commader builds up uses a bunch of umbrellas stacked atop one another to slide down the main street of Jingzhou firing wrist-mounted crossbows to take out all the town guards. </p>

<p>Is it kinda silly? Yes. Is it incredibly epic at the same time? Also yes.</p>

<p>I really can't get enough of this movie and think everybody should give it a watch. Let me know if you've ever seen this movie in the comments and if you liked it as much as I did!</p>
