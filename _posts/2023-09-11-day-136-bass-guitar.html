<p>My roommate got a bass guitar today, and its a very cool piece of technology. Somehow, a big long piece of wood with metal strings and electronic magnets makes a really nice sounds to play with. There are so many different physical concepts conjoined into a single device that it makes my head spin. Electromagnetism, harmonics, materials science, music theory, and sheer artistry all spun up into one. We put so much of our understanding of the universe into making cool noise. I can't help but wonder about it.</p>
