<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We've had intermittent thunderstorms the last couple days where I am. I like a good storm. They make everything feel a little cozier inside, and just the whole concept of an electric discharge in the sky making a noise so loud it rattles your house is very cool in my opinion. There is one side effect however. They make me really lethargic. I don't want to go outside, work on anything, or do anything but lay there with a good book and listen to the rain. While I love writing, it does feel like work most of the time, so the storms have been getting in the way. It's weird the effect they have. I start thinking differently, more erratically, and when I read back the writing it all seems disconnected. I start writing in fragments and weird little offshoots that don't make much sense. It's a lot of extra work for future me.</p>

<p>As I write this it's just started up again. I wonder how long this one will last?</p>
