<p>I'm at the beach, so naturally today will be a short post. Who can resist baking in the sun for hours in a salty, sandy environment where the grit gets into everything and rubs the space between your toes raw? Kidding of course, I do love the beach, even if the sand does get into everything. I love relaxing in the shade of an umbrella with a nice cool drink and nothing to do but watch the sun glide across the sky and listen to the sound of waves crashing on the shore. How can such a powerfully erosive force make such a comforting noise? </p>
