<p>It's Friday again and to round up the week I wanted to do a quick post today about the progress I made. I've been trying to stick to 2000 words per day for a five day work week, making 10,000 words per week. Unfortunately I'm way behind, much more so than last week. I'm on track to get about half of what I was aiming for by the end of today. What can I say? Writing is hard. </p>

<p>I've been struggling to put all the words down that I need to, so looks like I'm not going to be able to take the weekend off. Hopefully the extra couple of days will help me hit the goal of 10,000, but I may just need to adjust my expectations here. I'm trying to avoid that because I want to push myself, but 10,000 is a lot. I'll see what I can get done today and over the weekend and reevaluate come Monday. Hopefully I can hit the goal or at least get close and I won't need to make any adjustments. If I can't do it with an extra two days I think it is just too much though. </p>

<p>Today's post is going to end here because I want to get right into it, but thanks for reading, and I'll have something more interesting for you come Monday.</p>
