<p>I was travelling most of today and I wasn't able to get much writing done. Also (like an idiot) I managed to forget 'The Cuckoo's Calling' at my grandparents' house, so I won't be able to write my review until Monday. I promise I'll get that done at some point. I have mixed feelings about it anyway and I think I need to do some serious thinking about that one over the weekend even though I haven't finished it yet. </p>

<p>As far as my own writing goes, I'm still editing 'Jeffries' but I'm not really sure what I'm even doing with it. It feels bad to leave it in the state that it's in but I don't know what else I would do to fix it either. The villain is still monologuey even though I edited it down, and the other part is still expository even though I tried my best. I guess it'll just be another one that doesn't feel as good as it could for a while. At some point I'll read those sections to my writing group and maybe they'll give me some good advice. I hope so anyway. </p>

<p>In the mean time, I think I'm going to go back to writing for competitions for a while. I still don't want to edit 'Oneiromancer' for some reason. That one feels frankly unsalvageable. </p>

<p>Kind of a low point, but there's nothing to do but keep writing now. </p>
