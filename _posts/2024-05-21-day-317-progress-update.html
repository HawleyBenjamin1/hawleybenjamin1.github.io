<p>I've hit a big roadblock in editing Oneiromancer that I'm not sure how to overcome. I realized that there's a subplot I included that doesn't do much for the story, and in fact serves more to distract from the best parts of it than anything. I'd like to get rid of it, BUT there's a lot tied into the subplot and unfortunately that means a bunch of changes, even to stuff I've already edited. I guess I'll just have to bite the bullet on this one and rework every single mention of this subplot. It's going to be quite the headache honestly. Fortunately I think I realized subconsciously how weak that part of the story was while writing and failed to include it later in the story. That means less to change at least. </p>

<p>Besides my editing struggles, I've got a response deadline coming up. Months ago I submitted a story for a 'Book of Choices' competition and the announcement for finalists is in just ten days now. I hope I made it cause waiting this long without any news at all is just the worst. I was pretty happy with that story as a whole so I think my chances are decent. I think it was also a pretty small competition compared to the others I've submitted to. The less competition the better in this case. In any event I'm looking forward to reading the winning stories. I'll be sure to post a link to the competition's results after they're out.</p>
