<p>Having two projects in need of editing at the same time is the worst. Now I don't have anything to distract myself from editing. Unless ...</p>

<p>Just kidding. I need to finish Jeffries first, I just have to get it done and it's already in motion. I would like to start brainstorming some story ideas though. I think it's good to have several things ticking away in the background but I don't have much right now. Lately a lot of stuff I end up thinking about would probably work better as a comic or a motion picture rather. There's lots of concepts I could probably use, but the overall story just doesn't fit the written word very well. I do have a few half-finished works that I could probably go back and have a look at. The problem is if I abandoned them in the first place it was probably for a good reason. Usually if I get bored with something after a few pages it's a bad sign for the rest of the story. There's gotta be <em>something </em>I could use though. Maybe I'll post an excerpt or something if any of it strikes me.</p>
