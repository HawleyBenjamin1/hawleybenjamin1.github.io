<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ever since covid lockdown I've been looking for an in-person writers group to join without much luck, but today, finally, I found one. It looks perfect. It's a sci-fi/fantasy writers group that meets up on Saturdays for presentations. Writers read their stories, and listeners give some feedback. It's very small and simple and I think I'll enjoy it a lot, so I signed up for the next meeting. If it goes well I guess I'll end up bringing a story of my own in at some point, but I don't have much recent material that I'd want to show off. I'll probably just hand out a chapter of 'Oneiromancer' at some point and maybe 'Jeffries' once I finish up with it. Getting some consistent feedback on my writing will be such a boon. I hope it works out. </p>
