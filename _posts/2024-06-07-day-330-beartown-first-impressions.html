<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I picked up the first book in a trilogy called 'Beartown' by Fredrik Backman for an upcoming book club I'll be attending soon. It centers on a small town hockey team with dreams of winning nationals, I believe in Norway, where the author is from. I'm not sure what to think yet exactly. This isn't my usual kind of novel, but hey, I joined the book club so I could get exposed to some new stuff. The style is ... interesting. I read one reviewer who described it as 'lyrical,' though I'm not really sure how well that applies. Once I wrap my head around it a little better I'll be able to give a better synopsis. The opening is strong though, with a surprisingly hooking intro. I'm excited to read the rest of this one and see how it goes. Not sure if I'll ever get to the next two books though.</p>
