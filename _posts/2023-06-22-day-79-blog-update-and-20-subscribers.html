<p>I was checking out the blog stats today and it looks like I recently hit 20 subs from WordPress.com! Thank you to everybody who subscribed, I really appreciate the support and I hope you're enjoying the blog so far. I know it must be a little weird reading a literary blog from someone who isn't even published, but hopefully some day soon I will remedy that issue and then we can both claim that we knew it was a sure thing all along. </p>

<p>I'm planning on making another retrospective post next week to get some of my thoughts in order, so look out for that on Monday or Tuesday. Also coming soon are some more thoughts on the Chekhov short story collection I've been reading, and after I finish that one I'll get to do another book haul! Because everybody knows the best part about reading books is actually the part where you buy them first. Thank you again for the support, and have a good Thursday.</p>
