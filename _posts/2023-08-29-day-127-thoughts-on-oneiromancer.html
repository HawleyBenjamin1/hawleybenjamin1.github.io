<p>I've been on a roll the past couple days and I pumped out almost 3000 words somehow. I guess I hit a fun part of Oneiromancer. Well all of it should be fun, but figuring out how to make the in-between parts read well is more of a challenge than writing the parts that are fun all on their own. I think I should try to integrate more direct language to get the job done for some of these scenes that should go by a little faster, maybe that would make them more fun to write as well. There's no sense in lingering on something boring if I can make it short and sweet and still have some tension going on to keep the reader interested. Easier said than done I guess. </p>

<p>Right now I'm almost at the end, but I need to finish a couple of scenes that I wasn't sure how to round out. Now that I know where things end up I'm sure those missing parts will be easier to fill in. Other than that, I think most of the editing process will be to nail down pacing and make sure there are no plot holes. Maybe I can weave another character's subplot into the slower parts of Clara's journey to make sure things stay spicy. I didn't want to do that initially, but the more thrillers read the more I see the appeal. It's just so hard to keep the pacing right when there's only one character to put to work. Maybe I don't need it, I guess I'll see after giving it a read through. That's weird to think about, reading my own book. Like writing a big piece of software, I can't hold it all in my head at once. I'll be fixing bugs as I read, reminding myself of the purpose of certain lines, trying to parse what past Ben was doing (and probably questioning his judgment pretty hard). Maybe I just need better documentation, lol.</p>
