<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I found a really cool competition yesterday that I'm going to submit something for called Six Word Wonder. It asks for up to four stories of exactly six words each. All you have to do is write six words four times, how hard could it be? </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When I found it I thought, 'Who ever thought of writing a six word story?' Well it was Doug Weller, apparently, who runs the website that hosts the competition. <a href="https://www.dougweller.net/contest">You can check it out here if you're interested.</a> There's no entry fee, and no excuses. Only six words. Surely I can come up with six words ... now there's just the question of what order to put them in ... hmm ...</p>
