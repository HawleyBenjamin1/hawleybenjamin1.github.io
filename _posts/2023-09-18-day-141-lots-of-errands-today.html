<p>Short post today cause I've got lots to take care of, but none of it writing related sadly. I hate running errands, and the universe decided to hand me a pile of them that all need doing now. Funny how that happens. At least it will give me some time to think while doing menial stuff. Tomorrow's post will probably be a lot more interesting given I'll have nothing to do with my brain but think about it. I've got to get going, but I hope everyone has a happy Monday. If such a thing exists.</p>
