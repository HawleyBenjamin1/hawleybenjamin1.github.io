<p>I didn't have much for the blog today, but I do have an update for next week. I'll be traveling on Tuesday, and the next few days will be taken up with activities too, so I might not get around to writing as much. I haven't been the most consistent blogger lately anyway, but next week I might have more cop out posts than usual. Tomorrow I'll have my review of 'What the River Buries' ready, then I'll be starting on 'A Cuckoo's Call.' Also, I added a book to this latest book haul without mentioning it called 'The Deceptor's Call,' a supernatural horror story that I think will fit very well with the spooky season's themes. </p>
