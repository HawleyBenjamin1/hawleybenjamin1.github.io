<p>Sorry for the late post today everyone, I took a 'power nap' that turned into a regular nap that turned into sleeping for as long as I can possibly get away with which is usually how it goes. Sometimes though I can sleep for the prescribed amount and it gives me a huge boost to my writing session. I risk it because the one in three or four times that it works more than makes up for the other failures. I'm not sure why exactly but if I start writing as soon as I wake up it tends to go really well. I've been experimenting with it for a while with good results, but like I said it often goes awry and I end up sleeping much longer than I was supposed to. </p>

<p>If you Google power naps you'll find several lengthy lists of geniuses who also enjoyed a good nap. From Aristotle to Einstein, Napoleon (?!?) and Winston Churchill, Salvadore Dali and Stephen King, these guys all swore or still swear by a nap. Anything you want to accomplish from art to conquering the world can apparently be significantly aided by passing out for a while before doing it. I will never understand the human body. </p>
