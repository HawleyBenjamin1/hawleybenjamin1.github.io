<p>I may or may not have let a nap get carried away with me. It was only supposed to be a couple of hours, I swear! I had written a scene in 'Jeffries' and gotten a big errand done too, so I figured, what's the harm? I'll get that blog done after I wake up and get some dinner. Then my alarm woke me up like eight hours later. Isn't that how it always goes?</p>

<p>Anyways, now I'm going to put on my cool nighttime playlist and stare at a screen for another two hours while I try to come up with something cool to write. I figure there's not much else to do in the late hours of the night. Its either that or head to my kitchen and scrounge for scraps like a rat. I think its the best part and the worst part of being a writer. I can get my work done at any time. But also, I can get my job done at literally any time and so there's no good excuse after an elongated nap steals half a day away. Hopefully I can make it all worthwhile with another couple thousand words.</p>
