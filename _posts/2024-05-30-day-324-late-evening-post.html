<p>I went on a four hour train ride but shamefully ignored my opportunity to write a blog post. Instead I'm now writing much later than my optimal writing time and just hoping I can squeak out the post at the end of the day. Fortunately, I have a good topic ...</p>

<p>Writing past dark is an interesting experience. It's only ten right now, but 2 AM or later it gets weird. In my experience I either write something half ingenious, half illegible, or just plain old insane. I only do it when there's really something on my mind that needs to be on the page immediately. Rarely do I come up with something well worth it. Some people swear by late night writing sessions though, with some authors like Brandon Sanderson even taking the midnight shift to have more time to write in the owl hours. Maybe it just takes practice, or maybe I'm just not cut out for it. I'm leaning toward the latter after getting through this post.</p>
