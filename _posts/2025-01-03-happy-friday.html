<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Just a slow day today. Still trying to get Jekyll figured out, but I do think this is the direction I want to go. The combination of customization, prebuilt frameworks, and zero cost to host my blog makes it irresistible. I tried some other sites similar to wordpress but frankly all of them had the same issues. High cost for not much of what I want. The only thing I'm missing out on by using Jekyll to create a site and github to host it is that I won't have access to a platform that will promote my content. It's a big thing to miss out on, but I think I might be able to expand in other ways.</p>
