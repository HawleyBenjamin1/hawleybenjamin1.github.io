<p>Hey I hit 200! This feels less impactful than 100 somehow ... in fact, it could be said that it is exactly half as impactful. Funny how that works. Anyway, I'm happy to have made it this far, and I plan on keeping up the habit for as long as possible. Next milestone is looking to be the big ol' 365, though I'll probably have something to say at the 300 mark. </p>

<p>Given the milestone, I think I'm going to institute some changes around here. So far I've been using the bare minimum package on WordPress to host my blog, but that just isn't quite good enough anymore. I'm going to upgrade so I can use 3rd party addons to improve the viewing experience (and because it's the only way to host more than 100 links on a single page, which is not at all annoying or scammy). Look forward to some improvements to the homepage and the content page by the time I post on Monday. Also, I may change up the look a little bit if I find something more pleasing to the eye. Darkmode has always been my goto for text on a page. It's classic, simple, and nobody has ever really complained about it to my knowledge. That being said, maybe it's time for something more daring.</p>
