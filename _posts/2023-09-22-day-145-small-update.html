<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Made some good progress this morning and managed to finish off another chapter. I really can't wait to start editing so that's been my motivation for the last week or two. Finish sooner so I can edit sooner. I've read a lot of people dread this part but since it's my first time editing I'm still looking forward to it. Maybe that will change in a couple months when I'm stressing over the order of chapters, haha.</p>
