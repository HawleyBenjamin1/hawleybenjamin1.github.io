<p>The time seems to pass so fast, I can't believe it's Friday again already. I finished up Jurassic park but the review will have to wait till Monday. Instead of a regular review, I'm thinking I'll do a review where I focus on comparing and contrasting the book and the movie to make it a little more interesting. This was a really good one and I'm looking forward to writing the review.</p>

<p>Sorry for the late post today, I woke up early this morning and then proceeded to shut down a few hours later and curl up in bed involuntarily. I can't breathe through my nose all the sudden and I have a weird headache. Looking outside, the air quality here is awful due to the wild fires, so maybe that has something to do with it. Or maybe I just caught a cold, who knows. I couldn't ever figure a way to schedule posts on Wordpress so I'm stuck posting these manually. I need a better system for sure, so looks like I have something to work on this weekend. Ugh, I need my nostrils back in working order first though. </p>

<p>Hope everybody has a good Friday, and if you're getting these air quality warnings like I am, try not to inhale too much smoke.</p>
