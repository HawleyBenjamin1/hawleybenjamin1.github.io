<p>Last weekend into Monday was one of my best progress periods ever. I had a rough day the next day, but managed to salvage things and keep on trucking. Yesterday I wrote a short story that came out pretty well, but got a little lax on the editing. My aim is still to finish off the first editing pass by the end of the month, so I better get on it. If I can keep the pace up, I should make it in no time flat. All in all, a good week for writing.</p>

<p>Now if only I could get my dang book. I still haven't received it. This is starting to get out of hand. I'll have to read the whole thing in like two days now before the meeting. It's making me question whether I want to buy from thriftbooks in the future even though they've been so good to me in the past. Oh well.</p>
