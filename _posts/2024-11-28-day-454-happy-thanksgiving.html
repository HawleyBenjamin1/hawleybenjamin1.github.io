<p>Today I'm thankful for all the time I've gotten to spend doing what I love, and all the people who've supported me so that I can. My family, my friends, and of course, you the reader. Thank you so much for helping me to follow my dreams. I hope everyone has as happy a Thanksgiving as I've had.</p>
