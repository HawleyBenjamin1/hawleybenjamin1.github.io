<p>Had a busy day today, hence the late post.</p>

<p>My focus this week has and will be the competition. I've written a few different stories, none of them very good, but I think I'm on to something now. You'll just have to wait and find out!</p>

<p>I've also continued work on the new blog. It's not up yet, but I got the migration working and everything else seems to be good to go too. The only issue is that I won't be able to use github to host like I thought I would. I knew it was too good to be true, so I kept digging and it turns out I'm not allowed to host a site that's larger than a gigabyte. Unfortunately, with all the images I've uploaded over the last year and a half, my blog is bigger than a gig. I'll have to look elsewhere for hosting, but from what I've read, it's not too difficult to migrate a github hosted website to another hosting service. My plan now is to build the website using the github.io domain how I would like, then once I want to host the full version I'll migrate over to a host that will let me do whatever I want for a fee. </p>

<p>I've gotten some work in on 'Jeffries' too, after talking to a friend of mine interested in making me a cover for it. I was more than happy to hear that and got together to hash out some designs for it. I'll hear back from him in a week or two. I'm excited to see what he comes up with!</p>
