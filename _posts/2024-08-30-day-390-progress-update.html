<p>Happy Friday everyone. Had a huge day yesterday and got about four thousand words down, a poem finished off, and I managed to convince Amazon to add my name as an author to the 'Book of Choices' page on their website. Guess which one took the most effort?</p>

<p>I haven't had much time for content this week, but next week I'll have a review ready for the sequel to 'Beartown,' 'Us Against You.' I'm not liking it quite as much as I did 'Beartown' so far. I was planning on binge reading it over the weekend like I did the last one, but it didn't grab me quite the same way. Hopefully it picks up in the second half. I'll also be sure to make a post linking to the 'Book of Choices' podcast, because yes, there will be a podcast version kind of like an audiobook. I'm excited to hear some of the other stories. Not sure how I feel about having someone else read my own story aloud though. I may have to skip that one.</p>
