<p>I'm traveling today. I hate riding in a car for more than a couple hours, but at least I'm not driving myself this time. On the bright side, this will give me plenty of time to daydream. Most of the writing occurs in my head, so I've got no excuse not to take advantage of a long ride to formulate some scenes. Maybe when I arrive four hours from now I can get it all down for real. </p>
