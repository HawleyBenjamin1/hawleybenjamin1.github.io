<p>I'm going to focus on Oneiromancer this week so it looks like I'll have to treat the blog more like a normal blog. Hi, how are ya, my day went fine, I ate at this cool restaurant over the weekend, the family is good, here's a pic of my dog. At least, that's the impression I've always gotten from bloggers. I think most people just use them to post about how they feel. That's pretty much what I do too, usually I only restrict it to how I feel about a certain writing related topic. I guess today I can branch out like I'm doing a marvel crossover. Is it just me or was it weird how they started doing slice of life shows for superheroes for second there? </p>

<p>I'm feeling pretty good today, mostly because I have all day to write and nothing better to do. I'm excited to move forward with this next part of Oneiromancer's plot. I'm approaching the mirror moment where the MC Clara has to decide what she wants to become in her story, so it should be an interesting week. It'll make or break the story so I'm a little nervous about how to execute it too. I guess I'm just gonna have to hop right to it!</p>
