<p>Sorry folks, had some connection problems this morning so the usual post didn't get there when it usually does. There wasn't much to say today anyhow, so I don't think it is too much of a loss this time around. Annoying to say the least though. </p>

<p>I started on 'The Hunt For Red October' but I'm not far enough to have made up my mind yet. It is a little dry in comparison to 'The Spy Who Came in From the Cold' so far. That novel had suspense dripping from every word though so it's a harsh comparison. I'll cover the book in more detail tomorrow, and maybe have another trope post the next day. I've been thinking about covering another kind of sci-fi engineering marvel, and given I'm reading Red October, I think battleships are all too fitting.</p>
