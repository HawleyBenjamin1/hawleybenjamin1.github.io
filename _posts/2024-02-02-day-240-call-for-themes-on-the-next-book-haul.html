<p>I've been thinking about a theme for the next book haul. I finished up with the last few books, except for 'Anything is Possible' which I couldn't get through a single chapter of. I was going for intrepid books last time (that is, intrepid for me to attempt to read them), and that one was way over the line. It immediately struck me as dry, expository, and rambling. I didn't care, and knew I never would. So, back to the library with that one. </p>

<p>Next up, impossibly tragic World War II books. No, just kidding. I'm not sure what I want to do yet or if it will even have a theme this time around. Maybe I'll just head to the library and see what strikes me. If you have any suggestions, I'd love to see them in the comments.</p>
