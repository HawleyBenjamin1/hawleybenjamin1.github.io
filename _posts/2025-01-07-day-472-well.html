<p>I kinda got the blog up. See if you can <a href="https://hawleybenjamin1.github.io/dangerousdayjob.github.io/">access this page</a>, let me know in the comments if you can't get there. Right now, this site is nothing but an html template that doesn't even have css. I mean, it should have css, but for some reason it won't load. Also, I can't get any pictures to load either. Oh and the template has a bunch of stuff I don't need at all, and I'll have to add in some extra stuff for email subscription and a link to my current blog, and I'll have to import all my old posts and, I'll need to add all my existing subscribers, and, and, and. But on the bright side, I got the hard part of deploying a site finished up! Assuming everybody else can access it too that is. </p>

<p>Anyway, it's the opposite of something special, but still a step in the right direction.</p>
