<p>Short post today because I want to get straight to the story. I haven't made much progress in the past week or so because I can't seem to make a decision when it comes to this subplot. I think I'm going to edit what I have as best I can and see if it works after I can read through a complete second draft. It's so hard to analyze whether it works well or not mid edit. I'm not sure how anybody does this as quickly as big name authors do. It's like playing whack a mole. Solve one problem, and another half dozen rear their ugly heads a chapter later. This is easily one of the most frustrating things I've ever tried to do.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to it I guess.</p>
