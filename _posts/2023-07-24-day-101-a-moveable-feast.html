<p>Ernest Hemingway's <em>A Moveable Feast</em>, put in the simplest terms, is a memoir about his early days as a writer living in Paris in the mid 1920s. In reality though, it's so much more than that. His daily life, his relationships, his struggles and his triumphs, are all presented through a series of semi-connected stories, each with their own individual focus. Their relation to one another is, at times, merely chronological, but the thematic resonance of his life experiences often shine through when you least expect it. These stories are, of course, in the author's distinct spartan style, a testament to the power of (as the man himself puts it) creation over description. He doesn't just tell you how it was to live in the ever evolving city of Paris, and be with the many famous authors celebrated in this memoir, but creates a world for you to inhabit that happens to be based on his true life. As is stated in the preamble: </p>

<p>"If the reader prefers, this book may be regarded as fiction. But there is always the chance that such a book of fiction may throw some light on what has been written as fact."</p>

<p>If you've ever fantasized about the life of a great writer, the misadventures that fuel creativity, and the human connections that forge a person into whatever they may become, this is the book for you. It allows a glimpse through the eyes of one of the most celebrated and influential authors of all time, and more than that, gives insight into the lives of all the authors that influenced him, and those that he influenced in turn. Hemingway's experiences share the page with those of famous authors and poets such as Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and many others. The way he casually name drops Pablo Picasso as an acquaintance of his, presents an overheard conversation with T.S. Elliot, or how he attempted unsuccessfully to convince Fitzgerald that his size is perfectly acceptable (yes, that kind of size), makes this novel what it is. Paris as well, is a character all its own, a thriving metropolis that Hemingway knows like the back of his hand. He unabashedly presents its dirtiest alleys and poorest quarters in full light, just as important and true to its character as the wonderful art, beautiful people, and the monuments that everybody already knows. His friends and enemies are likewise framed in unflinching truth, and how those elements of who they are, both good and bad, add up to a more wholesome and complete person than they could possibly be otherwise. The man himself is no exception, and the bravery inherent in telling of his inner thoughts, outright failures, financial struggles, and most of all, his insecurities as a writer, make this truly something special to read. </p>

<p>I can't recommend this book enough if you've ever been a fan of Hemingway's, though maybe a peek behind the curtain would stain your vision of him just as it enhances its clarity. The fallouts and the failures and the flaws inherent to a man living a hundred years ago can be more than a little off-putting at times, but it is well worth it to understand the formative years of someone who has had such an impact on literature and culture in general. His unique perspective is valuable beyond words to an aspiring writer like myself, and I hope it will be as valuable to any who read it as it has been to me. </p>
