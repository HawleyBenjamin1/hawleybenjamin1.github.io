<p>I can't recall if I've ever read a memoir, so I'm just going to say this is the first one I've given a real shot. I'm several chapters in after this book grabbed me immediately. Author John Samuel writes about his experience with degenerative eye disease as a young man, and his time traveling abroad while dealing with the reality of losing his vision. It sounds like it would be one of the most morbid topics on planet Earth, but Samuel's dogged positivity enables him to flip the script and turn what would be for many a terrible ending into a beautiful beginning. This book is equal parts crushing and adventurous, full of moments of fear and sorrow contrasted by incredible stories that capture the human spirit. Samuel's belief that people are good and helpful at heart fuel the stories he tells about his time abroad. It's shaping up to be a surprisingly feel-good memoir with quite a lot of life advice to boot.</p>

<p>I've never read a book quite like this one, and that's always a treat for me. I love finding new things and books are one of the best ways to capture an experience that's otherwise impossible to have. There are so many little techniques I've learned already from reading the book that focus on other senses so often left by the wayside when forming imagery. Samuel's ability to capture the heart of a setting without supplying much visual information is obviously borne from necessity, but that need has given him a gift that many writers will never bother to hone. His journey is not defined by the grand vistas and sweeping landscapes that so many authors use to put the reader in the scene, but rather the texture of the sidewalks and the tiling of buildings, the shape of curbs (that is, if there are any), the particular feeling of the wind on his face, the sounds and smells and flavors that innervate a place. And of course, the unique behavior of the people around him. It's such a refreshing way to experience the world that I'm almost convinced everybody else is doing it wrong. I feel more immersed and connected to the author when both of us are in the dark than I do when I can see everything. It's an interesting, and sometimes harrowing read with a lot to learn from. </p>
