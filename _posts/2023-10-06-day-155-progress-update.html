<p>Another week, another progress update. I've pushed out most of another chapter and should be able to round it out today. I think I'll be able to finish the draft by chapter 30, and I'm just finishing up chapter 27. I only have one last major scene to include, which will probably take up the next two or three chapters. It should be an exciting one. </p>
