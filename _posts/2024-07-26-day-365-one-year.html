<p>365 days of Dangerous Day Job!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who read the blog at some point along the line. I'm not sure I would have kept up without your support. It's been such a valuable routine for me and I'm glad there's at least a few people out there to keep me honest. I've learned a lot this past year, and much of it has been while writing for this very page alone. Literary techniques, thematic elements, the history of fictional technology, and so much more! I refined my reviews, I stretched my brain researching and writing articles, and even put up a few stories I felt good about. This has been a wonderful experience and I'm glad I took on the challenge of keeping up with a blog. Some days it's been great, and some days it's been the last thing I wanted to do, but I'm proud to say I made it 365 days without missing a single post. I don't think I've ever done anything that regularly, that long, without missing it at least a time or two. All in all, I'm happy to have this blog to my name.</p>
