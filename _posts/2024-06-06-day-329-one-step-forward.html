<p>Today while scrolling to get back to the place where I had edit up to in Oneiromancer, my eye caught on a sentence that needed a rework. Then the next sentence needed a rework too. Then the next. And before I knew I reedited the whole dang chapter than I had already been though and spent a bunch of time working on something that should have already been water under the bridge. Now I'm back to the next chapter I thought I had finished up and seeing stuff that could use another look in there too ... It just never ends. It's really hard to put it behind me and keep forging onward even though I know if I don't do that I'll never actually make any progress. I'm sure this is nothing new for any author but man. It kinda sucks seeing stuff I marked as done be so in need of extra attention. I guess I'll just keep working on this stupid thing forever if I have to.</p>
