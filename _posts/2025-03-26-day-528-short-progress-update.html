<p>I've had a pretty slow week of incremental progress on 'Jeffries.' Besides that, I submitted some old stories for publication after some touchups here and there, but I haven't heard anything back on any of those. Of course if any of them get published I'll be gushing about it here the second I sign the contract.</p>

<p>The only other thing I've been doing is a lot of reading. I still have 'The Ferryman' by Justin Cronin and 'Pushing Ice' by Alastair Reynolds on my list by the way. I got distracted by other good books, but the book haul remains in progress! I'm hoping to finish up 'Morphotrophic' tomorrow and jump right into the next one. Since 'Pushing Ice' is a series, I think I'll read 'The Ferryman' first so I won't be tempted into another long reading before I finish the haul. Should be a lot of fun!</p>
