<p>I'm almost to day 100! I'm thinking about doing something special for the occasion but I'm not sure what would be most appropriate. I think the review for A Moveable Feast could fit there, but a regular old review doesn't have quite the pomp I'm looking for. I'm sure I'll come up with something fun. </p>

<p>Today's going to be a short post because my hands are sore. Every single interest of mine involves using my hands. Writing, guitar, video games, all of it. I try not to stress them too much but I'm afraid they're gonna look like claws by the time I'm 30 if I'm not more careful. I'll be sure to have something interesting for tomorrow though! </p>
