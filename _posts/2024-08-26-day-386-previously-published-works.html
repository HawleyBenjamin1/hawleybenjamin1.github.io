<p>Today I learned that there are all kinds of competitions and publications that also accept previously published works. I mean I knew that already. But I didn't realize there were so many! I don't have much at all published currently (and one of them will be solely owned for the next year) but I do have a poem that I still own the rights to even though it was published before. I mention this because there is a big poetry contest I entered last year that will accept previously published poems. Of course I didn't win last year, but hey, I may as well enter with a poem I know is publishing quality already, right? </p>

<p>For all you poets and poetry lovers out there, this contest always has excellent finalists, though recommending this to a poet may be kinda like recommending 'The Odyssey' as if you just stumbled onto something new. </p>
