<p>I got a lot done this morning, so I'm feeling pretty good about my progress. Oneiromancer is coming along, and I worked on the beginning a new short story, and edited an old one I'm going to try to get published again. I've been working on the larger post about environmental storytelling I mentioned last week, but I'll probably need the weekend to finish it off. Not much else to report today. I'm going to hang out on the beach and watch the waves for the rest of the day. Hope everybody has a good Thursday!</p>
