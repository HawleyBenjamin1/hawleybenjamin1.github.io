<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Couldn't sleep last night so I stayed up late writing a little story about AI taking over the world for a competition someone is hosting on Reddit. I realized when I got to the end of the story that I went far beyond the competition's 1000 word limit, but I like the story a lot, so I'll probably end up submitting it elsewhere. That is, if I can find someone accepting submissions right now. Seems like nobody I want to submit to is taking them. Hopefully that situation will improve soon, it's been two and half months already and I need to find some inlets into this business. With ChatGPT soaking up all the content writing jobs, fiction is pretty much all I've got going for me. I'll see if I can't find somewhere to submit this one by Monday and post an update then.</p>
