<p>Well, I didn't quite make it in time. Oneiromancer remains unfinished at the end of August. I'm forced to extend my deadline to get it finished up. I'm shooting for the tenth now, and hopefully this will be the last extension on the first draft. I'd really like to get to editing the whole thing because I think that will be the most interesting part of all this. I find editing existing work more fun than pumping out new material for days on end. Maybe that will change when I get to editing it in such a large scope but for now I'm looking forward to it. It's just a few scenes standing in my way, but those scenes get a little longer every time I think about them. Feels like being stuck in mud.</p>
