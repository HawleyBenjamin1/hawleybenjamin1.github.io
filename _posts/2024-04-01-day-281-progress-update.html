<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I haven't made much progress in the last week on my novel, so I'm really going to have to buckle down this week. I did get a short story submitted for review and the exercises I did on the blog last week helped keep me sharp though. I think this week ought to be a good time to focus with other things out of the way. All I want to do is edit the novel and formulate another book haul. There have been too many things pulling me in different directions lately.</p>

<p>If you're wondering about the last book in the previous haul 'Random in Death,' it is 100% a DNF. I'm not even going to review it. All I'll say is I couldn't get through the first chapter.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>I'm still thinking of doing some rereads for my next haul. None that I've posted about before, with the exception of maybe 'On Writing.' That one I think would be ok to revisit because there's so much there to sift through. I'm not sure what else I'll add to the list though. Be on the lookout for the next book haul either tomorrow or Wednesday when I finish compiling. </p>
