<p>I've always secretly wanted to run into a conspiracy theorist who doesn't believe that we landed on the moon. Something about the mentality intrigues me. There's just so much evidence to the contrary, but none of it matters to them somehow. I guess if you have no trust in anything then you could feasibly come to the conclusion that every shred of proof for every accomplishment humanity has ever achieved has been faked. It's really kinda sad when I think about it that way. Aliens made all the pyramids, microchips were designed by AI overlords that secretly took over the Earth a long time ago, and the Titanic sank before making it to the Americas ... Wait. That does sound vaguely conspiracy theory-y to me. How was such a large and well crafted vessel sunk by a measly iceberg? I think I might be onto something here. </p>

<p>Anyway, if I really met someone like that, I think there'd be only one thing to do. It might be sad that they can't believe in anything, but there's not enough sympathy in the world to keep me from putting a condescending smirk on my face and asking if they <em>actually </em>still believe the moon exists.</p>
