<p>Today I decided to spend a little extra money on the blog and upgrade the site in a few ways. For one thing I have more customization options now, so you might see some minor changes to the look of the site. For two, I have access to control where the advertisements that you may see on my site show up. Currently they're set to sidebar ads and an additional ad at the bottom. The only issue is I can't seem to get any to show up. Obviously it's pretty hard to judge them when I can't even see them. I've tried multiple browsers, mobile, incognito, everything. If you do see any ads, let me know in the comments. I can move them around if they're too obtrusive. </p>

<p>In the next few days I'll set up some other nifty little bits and pieces to complete the site, but one of them is of key importance. I figure if I really want to have a go at this whole writing thing its high time I tried to monetize it a little. There are some preset methods on wordpress for adding a donations button that links straight to a paypal account. Frankly it feels a little weird to have a giant button that says 'please give me money' on the site so I might try to find something a little less aggressive. Then again ... money. Next thing you know the site will look like this:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":2629,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2024/04/image-2.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-2629" /></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Anyway keep an eye out for those changes that'll be coming soon!</p>
