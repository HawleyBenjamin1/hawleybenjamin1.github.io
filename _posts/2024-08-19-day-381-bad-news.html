<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So I can't type. Not the usual way anyhow. Through a combination of poor workout planning, bad left hand technique on the guitar, and a hell of a lot of typing, I have given myself some sort of tendonitis or other chronic pain in my left hand and made writing incredibly painful. I was planning on reviewing 'The Forge of God' tomorrow, but since I can't type very fast without being in a lot of pain, I think I'm going to sit on it. Expect some short posts this week. I'll probably be using my phone to type while my hand heals since I can more easily reach all of the keys with my good hand that way. I'm going to give it several days but if I don't see any improvement I guess I will have no choice but to see a doctor. Hopefully the pain subsides soon.</p>

<p>I'll take this week to do some more research into potential publishers instead of trying to get a bunch of writing done.</p>
