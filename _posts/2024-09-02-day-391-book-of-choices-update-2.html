<p>So, for some reason the anthology is going to be released on September 6th now. The countdown is no longer available on the Wolf Grove Media website, and I'm not really sure why the date changed, but unfortunately you'll have to wait till then to pick it up. Sorry to have mislead everybody, but I'm as in the dark as you are.</p>

<p>The podcast episodes are going to start coming out on the same date, hopefully those are still on schedule. Once the book comes out I'll post another amazon link here so anybody who wants to get a copy won't have to keep checking the page over and over. </p>
