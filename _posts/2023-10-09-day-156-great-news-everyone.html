<p>I finally got something published! Tulip Tree Publishing runs a yearly competition called Stories that Need to be Told, and they kindly selected my poem 'Mayflies' as the winner of the depth category. It's about a story that's been going on for millions of years, and is perhaps closer to our own life experience than it would seem at first glance.<em> </em>It will be published in the Stories that Need to be Told Anthology sometime soon. You can check out the competition, the other winners, and the rest of Tulip Tree Publishing right here:</p>

<p>I'm so happy to have made some progress and taken a tangible step forward in this whole journey. This means that everything is perfectly smooth sailing from here on out. Right? Right!?!</p>
