<p>Dracula is dragging a bit. It's surprisingly slow for what was described in the introduction as a 'slightly cheesy thriller' in its day. It is a master class in shifting perspectives however, so I'm happy to take it slow and digest all that I can. I don't think I've ever seen a book shift from character to character this rapidly. Each character has their own journal and the story is presented through their journal entries. They all have strong voices that shine in the format, so I guess Bram Stoker really knew what he was doing. Sometimes he even throws in newspaper articles, allowing him to describe a scene from a more objective third person perspective. He uses this to convey sweeping natural landscapes better than any author I've read. The natural beauty of the setting that he fixates on makes for an excellent contrast to Dracula's evil. I'm not sure exactly where the story is going at the moment but I think my uncertainty fits the looming terror of Dracula perfectly. </p>

<p>I should finish up by Monday for a full review, so look out for that! In the meantime I'll just be focused on the main project as usual. Hope everybody has a good Thursday.</p>
