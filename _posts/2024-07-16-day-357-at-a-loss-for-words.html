<p>This weekend was one of my most productive ever, almost 70 pages of editing, plus I added a few missing scenes I had left for later. Today though, I'm at a complete loss. I guess I used up every last word I had stored up. They'd better be back tomorrow, cause I'd like to hop back on that hot streak as soon as possible. </p>
