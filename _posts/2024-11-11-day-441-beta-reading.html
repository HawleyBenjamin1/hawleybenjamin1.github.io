<p>I've been doing a lot of beta reading lately, summing up my thoughts on others' work, and it's been different than I imagined it would be. After writing plenty of reviews of completed works, I figured it would be about the same. Read the book, come to some conclusions about what I liked and what I didn't, and try to fit those thoughts into a reasonable amount of space. Forming an opinion on a finished work feels pretty safe though. It's out there, it's done, and it is what it is. My opinion on it just my opinion, and who cares what I think really? It's more of an exercise to help remember the books I read than anything. With a beta read though, there's a bigger sense of responsibility. Since the work is still being written, my opinion might actually have an impact on the final product. Ignoring the given fact that every writer has the final call, it still makes me rethink every single opinion I have, and I'm not so sure it's a good thing. My first impressions may be very different compared to what I think about the novel after some deeper thought, but at the same time, first impressions are very important too. I don't want to negatively impact anybody else's work. Rationally, I know I shouldn't worry so much. I myself have had a couple of beta readers for my own work now, and I know it's only ever helped me. Still feels weird though.</p>

<p>P.S. I'll be getting to my review of 'The Cuckoo's Calling' sooner or later. It's taking me a while to read this one. </p>
