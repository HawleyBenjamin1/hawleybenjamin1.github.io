<p>I'm going to start on my first editing pass today. Naturally I also received three rejection emails at the same time this morning. Nice to have a distinct feeling of failure swirling around while I judge and rework my own manuscript for the first time. Real nice. Reeeaaaaaallll nice.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I'll have an update on how it went and then the next day I should finish up 'The Fourth Wing' for a review. Should be a good one, the book was actually very enlightening. </p>
