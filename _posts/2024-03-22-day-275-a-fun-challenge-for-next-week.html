<p>I've noticed the blog is getting a little dull lately. Frankly I'm just running out of topics to cover. I guess every content creator runs into this wall at some point where you just don't really know where else to take the blog. That's why I'm going to use a tried and true method to liven up the place: stealing ideas from other people. And I don't want to hear any judgement until you've written 275 posts centering on a single discipline, ok?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The idea comes from a YouTube channel I've been watching lately called LowLevelLearning. This is actually a computer science channel that teaches about low level programming. The idea I'm stealing however has nothing to do with coding. He has a series of videos where he randomly selects a language to complete a challenge, with some of the languages being really tricky to actually accomplish anything with. My idea is to do essentially the same thing but with different authors. I'm going to pick a prompt from the internet, then randomly select an author I like from a list. After I have the author and the prompt, I'll attempt to respond to the prompt in the style of the randomly selected author as an exercise, then post the results here. I'll also include a sample of the real deal for comparison. I think I'll do this all next week, marking off authors as I go. Here's the list of authors I compiled, but if there are any suggestions from the comments I'll add those too.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --></p>
<ol><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Mark Twain, because of course.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Mary Shelley, because of course. </li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>MichaelÂ Crichton, and I think this one will be more difficult than it seems. A lot of the unique elements style come from the themes of his stories and the way they're structured rather than particular turns of phrase or anything like that.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Ernest Hemingway, because all I'll have to do is put tons of untagged dialogue in and that's basically the challenge ... right?</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Toni Morrison, because her stream of consciousness style is crazy hard.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>That'll cover all five days, but what other recognizable authors could I include? The more the merrier. </p>

<p>Thank you for reading,</p>
