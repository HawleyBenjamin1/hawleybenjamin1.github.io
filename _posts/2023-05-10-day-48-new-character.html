<p>Not much to talk about today, but I did get to add a new character to the series yesterday and that was fun. This is a character that won't play much role in the first book, but comes into play later in the series. I love introducing characters long before they come to play their main role in the story. She'll be a side character until she isn't. I get so excited when I see a side character become a mainstay seemingly out of nowhere, and it's those moments that keeps me writing.</p>
