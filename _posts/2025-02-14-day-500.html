<p>Hey, it snuck up on me! This is the 500th day of Dangerous Day Job. I almost can't believe it. Very nearly two years now since I started this blog, I find myself wondering how it all went by so fast. It's been an amazing time in my life where I've really gotten to follow my dreams. I've written some good stories (even published a couple), met some cool people, made some good friends, and most importantly, had a blast along the way. I'm happy to say it's the best decision I ever made. </p>

<p>Which will remain the case right up until I run out of money and find myself on the street. I'll probably turn to a reluctant life of crime after society rejects my talents, break bad and move to Gotham where I can setup my new syndicate and taunt Batman by leaving obscure literary references at the scene of all my crimes. Either way, everything will work out in my favor, I'm sure. </p>

<p>Well, it's back to the ol' grindstone for me. I'm happy I got my new blog out in time for Day 500, but there's quite a bit of work to be done still. The email system is still on my todo list. I'm not sure they aren't going out, but I signed myself up and it just doesn't work for some reason. Hopefully I'll get it solved by Monday!</p>
