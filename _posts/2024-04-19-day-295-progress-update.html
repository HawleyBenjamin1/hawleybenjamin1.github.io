<p>I've been more focused than usual this week. I edited a difficult chunk of Oneiromancer that I've been struggling with for a while. I think the key to getting the story where I want it to be is really nailing part one. I've been focused on the first 15 chapters or so, which have turned into more like 20 as I realize some events need to be cut, and some need to be their own chapter. I'm hoping to move to part two in the next couple of weeks. </p>

<p>'The Forest for the Trees' has given me a few good tips for keeping myself focused on the task at hand. I think reading these books on writing is going to turn out to be a big boon. I should've done it sooner really, but novels are just too entertaining. The only thing I'm worried about is that the review for these books might all be the same thing. "It's a book that teaches good. The end." Well, it might be a little more complicated than that. I'll do my best to compare and contrast what the different books have to offer. With three books of such similar subject matter it'll also be a good chance to analyze the authors' writing styles free without having to take the narrative into account. </p>

<p>I'm looking forward to a Monday for once because next week I'll finally get to attend this book club I've been wanting to go to. We'll be discussing Judi Picoult's 'Small Great Things.' I'm interested to hear some other perspectives on this one. </p>
