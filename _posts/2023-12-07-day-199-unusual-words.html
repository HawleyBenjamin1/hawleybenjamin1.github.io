<p>I know I shouldn't, but sometimes I enjoy working words in to my stories just because I like the way they sound. Usually it goes poorly and I have to go back and find a new phrasing. It's because I only like to hear the sound of certain words because they're unusual, and they're all rare for a good reason as it turns out. </p>

<p>Befuddled is one of them that I can't ever seem to get a good flowing sentence out of, but I always try it. Confused, distracted, vexed, or perplexed seem to take the place of befuddled whenever I go back through during edits. It feels a little too ... I'm not sure. Silly, I guess? Like I'm trying to make fun of the character who's befuddled rather than simply convey their lack of understanding. If anybody has a good use for this word, let me know. </p>

<p>Likewise, I never seem to find a good place for turquoise. There just aren't that many turquoise things in the world, and the things that are turquoise don't usually fit into the stories I want to tell. It just has a certain air about it that conveys too much about a character who has chosen to use a tool or wear a piece of clothing that is that color. A character with a turquoise spaceship, or turquoise dress is a very different person than someone who opts for a more typical color. Someone who uses that color regularly almost demands their own story as opposed to being fit into another story about someone or something else. It's annoying.</p>

<p>Another word I can't ever shoehorn in well enough is sumptuous. It just feels so pretentious. But that's also why I want to use it. It makes me think of a fat aristocrat trying out a new quiche and then trying desperately to complement his head chef in a way that will make him sound smart about it. </p>

<p>Alabaster, topography, undulating, temptuous (or even more difficult, though completely different in meaning, tempestuous), I could go on for a while. They're kinda like pokemon. Someday, I'll catch all of them in a well-formed sentence or two.</p>
