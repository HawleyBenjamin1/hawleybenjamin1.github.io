<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Today I've been puzzling over the best way to import images from WordPress to my new blog. After much thought, I think the real answer is 'only keep one blog, stupid,' but I'm hard headed and I need to keep this one at least until I can get the email service set up. The process of getting images over is still painful though, so I think I may avoid pictures for the next few days. The best part of the new blog is how customizable each blog post is since I can include anything I want using html and markdown, but that's also the problem. I have to put everything in myself if I want it to work. I can't seem to figure out how to export all the photos from this site easily so I end up having to fill in each and every photo manually by downloading them one at a time. It's about as far from ideal as I can get. </p>

<p>The email system should be more straightforward. Once it's set up, I should just be able to copy a list over from my current subscribers and continue sending out emails seamlessly. I'll also add a button to sign up on the blog once I get it going for new readers. After that, I should be ready to migrate over completely and host the blog from there then on out.</p>
