<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Currently I'm editing a couple of short stories as well as Oneiromancer. I hope to submit those by the end of the week. Other than that, there's not much to report. I'll have a book review out for 'The Covenant of Water' either tomorrow or the next day depending on when I finish it up. It's definitely a great book but it is a difficult one to stomach at times. </p>
