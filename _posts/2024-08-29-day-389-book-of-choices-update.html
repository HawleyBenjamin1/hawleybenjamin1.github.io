<p>It's almost the end of the week and I feel like I made decent progress since the last update. I entered that poetry competition, got my name out there a little bit at the author's meetup, and learned about some cool resources that I can leverage. I also got some progress down on Oneiromancer, but the main focus has been that short story I've been working on. I keep thinking it'll be done soon, but somehow it keeps getting longer. It's at like 15,000 words now. It'll be a very long short story or maybe a short novelette by the time I'm done with it. If this one doesn't get picked up by anyone, then I'll be publishing it myself, cause it's too much effort to leave on the shelf. </p>
