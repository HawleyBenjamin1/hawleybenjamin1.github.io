<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Not much to report today, but I'm back in the swing of things with my main story so I'm probably going to go back to writing some longer blog posts next week. I have a few outlines I want to fill out, and I still want to do a retrospective to analyze some of my earlier posts. Should be a good time! For this week I'm still focused on the main project. I was hoping to finish it off by the time Summer is over so I've got some work to do. </p>
