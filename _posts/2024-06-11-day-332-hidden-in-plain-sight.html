<p>Sometimes after editing a story for a long time, something will occur to me that brings it all together and makes the whole thing sing. Usually it's pretty obvious in hindsight. I love that feeling because it makes me feel like there's always a solution if I just look for one long enough. At this point I've begun to treat editing like a 'Where's Waldo?' puzzle. In fact I've become a little obsessed with the whole idea, to the point where I ended up on a page devoted to Waldo-esque problems called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FindTheSniper/">r/FindTheSniper</a>. Given a picture and a target object you have to search hard to identify it. The best ones are the ones where once you see it, you wonder how on Earth you could have ever missed it. Try this one out. Can you spot the snake? It may be obvious to some but it took me a couple minutes.</p>
