<p>Today I made a bunch of changes to 'Jeffries' based on the helpful advice I've gotten from 'Fixing It.' I'm hoping these changes will bring the story together and put all the events in line with a core problem that Jeffry is working to solve. In other words, I tried to make every piece of the story serve a single issue that's important to Jeffry. I'm not sure how well I succeeded at this, but it's a step in the right direction anyway. It was actually fewer changes than I thought I would need to make. A lot of what I already had worked well, it just didn't have the right context. By making a few small changes, I was able to recontextualize what I did have into something more focused on the core problem that Jeffry is facing.</p>

<p>The only problem I have now is that it does require a small new scene that I'll have to add in. I'm not sure where that scene should go though. Hopefully my beta readers will have some insight on that part.</p>

<p>Also, I'm still working on the 100 word story competition. It's a lot harder than it sounds, and it sounds pretty hard. I even put aside the other competitions I was working on because it's such an interesting problem. I have a few different stories for this competition, so maybe I'll post the ones I don't submit to the blog. Should be fun little reads even they don't make the cut.</p>
