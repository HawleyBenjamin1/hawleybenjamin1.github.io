<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm heading out to a literary convention tonight, which means I'll have left my house to socialize two days in a row. That may be some kind of sacrilege in the writing world. I'm pretty sure I read in the writer's union bylaws that doing so will disqualify you from all benefits. </p>

<p>Jokes aside, I'm not sure what to expect. The only other convention I've ever been to was a video game convention, and somehow I imagine this one will be quite a bit different. Maybe I'm wrong though. The main event will be a series of presentations by prominent local authors, publishers, and journalists who I'm hoping I can learn a lot from, including the CEO of a local publishing company as well as the editor of a big magazine centered in the Triangle. All in all, lots of interesting people!</p>

<p>I'll make another post about how it went tomorrow. Until then, as always:</p>
