<p>I finally got around to watching this award winning movie last night and it did not disappoint. Despite the fact that I've personally grown very tired of the infinite multiverse trope that inundates seemingly every franchise, I was really blown away by this movie on a conceptual level. It takes the trope and pushes it to the boundary of what it can be, while retaining all the charm and emotional impact of a tightly focused family drama. It has action, comedy, raw weirdness, deep characterization, pop cultural and social commentary, it really is what the title suggests. Never have I been so enthralled or felt such powerful feelings over a pair of rocks laughing at the silliness of their own existence. That is a real scene in the movie. No, really. Ok, I see I have to prove it to you, so here:</p>

<p>Getting to this point in the movie is truly an odyssey unlike any other and I highly recommend you just hop in without any preview. Telling you any part of the plot besides the obvious would be a disservice, and I may have already ruined some of it with the rock picture above, but I couldn't resist sharing that image. </p>

<p>All in all this is a wild, wacky adventure that says a lot about the human condition and what it means to be family. I hope you get the chance to see it on Prime while it's still available. </p>
