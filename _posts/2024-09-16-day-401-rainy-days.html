<p>Starting off the 400s with a bad one, today has been the dullest, dreariest day ever. The clouds have been so thick all day that when I got up this morning I thought I had woken up before the Sun came up. It makes me feel like I'm a sickly Victorian child who has to stay inside while all the other kids play because of a propensity for illness and fragile conformation. I'll pine for friends for years and develop some kind of inferiority complex that will boil over into violence when the only person who was nice to me through the window one time gets bullied outside my door. My frail composition will prevent me from defending my only friend, and the memory of how I was unable to help will stick with me for years. Later in life when I've acquired my  doctorate in something megalomaniacal, I'll use my expertise to craft a death ray and take out all that inner pain on the world. </p>

<p>Anyway, it's rainy outside and I don't like it.</p>
