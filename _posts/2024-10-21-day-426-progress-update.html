<p>I finished off 'Jeffries' last week and this week will be dedicated to a first editing pass. Also, good news, I've got a couple of people reading the story and giving me some feedback. It should help me improve much faster than if I were editing in the dark like I have been on everything else. I'm really excited to polish this project up into something nice. I think it's some of my best work so far and I hope I can get this one published, because if I can't get this one to work, I'm not sure what else I've got to work with. </p>

<p>I'm still reading 'What the River Buries' but I should have a review out this week. Funnily enough, the author is one of the people giving me feedback on 'Jeffries.' That should be an interesting back and forth. </p>

<p>Other than perpetually waiting to hear back from one publisher or another, I don't have much else going on. I'll just have to focus on what I've got.</p>
