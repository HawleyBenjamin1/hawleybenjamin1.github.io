<p>Well, I just got a response back for a story I really liked and no dice. Not sure where else to submit that one as it was kinda niche. I was thinking about posting it here instead just to get it out there, but I can't deny that it was a little disappointing. Maybe I'll stumble upon another magazine looking for something similar one day, but somehow I doubt it.</p>

<p>It got me thinking though, what <em>do </em>people do with all their rejected stories? It's been long enough now that I have a folder full of stuff I can't seem to get accepted anywhere. Do any of you writers out there ever go back and rework some of your old stories? Or do you let them stay as they were just to mark the progress you've made? I'm not sure what to do with all of mine.</p>
