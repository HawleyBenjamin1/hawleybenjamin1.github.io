<p>This morning before working on Oneiromancer I wrote a small short story. Flash fiction is a better way to describe it. I thought it would be good exercise for my hand to start slow. From the get go I knew it wouldn't be very good, but it was fun to write, and it reminded me that not everything has to be good to be enjoyable. Maybe one day I'll come back to it and edit it up a little. For now, it will go into my pile of misfit, malformed, and forgotten stories, the folder I dare not read from for fear of losing my mind. An abyss where I toss the refuse that comes out of my brain every so often. It's not a very nice place, but it has its purpose. Sometimes I just need to write something that I'll never look at again.</p>
