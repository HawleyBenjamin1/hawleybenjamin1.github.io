<p>It's funny, I've been working hard on this short story, but the whole time I've been getting better ideas for Oneiromancer than I have in a while. I guess my brain really just loves to procrastinate, even if it means working on something even harder. Strange how that happens. At least I have some new material to try and apply to the book. It'll require some big reworks at the end, but I think it'll be worth it.</p>

<p>Only problem is now I want to go write my book while this short story remains unfinished. It's frustrating to say the least. I really wish I'd stop looking at greener grass for a while.</p>
