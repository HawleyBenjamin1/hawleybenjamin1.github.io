<p>I had one more book in the last haul to review, but frankly I wasn't enjoying that one very much. It's not that 'Writing After Dark' is bad, it's just that I'm tried of reading something that isn't meant so much for entertainment as it is for learning. In other words, I'm bored. So I bought some sci-fi I heard about at the reading club meeting I went to last month called 'Revelation Space.' I bought three books in the series. From what I've read so far, it's pretty hard sci-fi with a lot of moving parts, heavy visualization, and a ton of advanced technology. It's been a while since I got lost in a book (in a good way) so I'm hoping this will deliver. If not, well I bought a 'well-used' copy, shall we say. It's all beat up and drawn in and stuff. I like reading the penciled in notes, but I know some people find it distracting. I do wish the pages hadn't been dog-eared so badly though, that just makes it harder to flip through them.</p>

<p>The story itself is cool so far, but a lot to keep track of. There's an archeological dig on Resurgam, a planet far from Earth, led by Dan Sylveste, a very old business man with daddy issues who is not very popular with the locals. He's obsessed with the artifacts buried beneath the surface, but will he be able to uncover them before the political climate finally turns his team against him? </p>

<p>Simultaneously, Ilia Volyova grapples with the degenerating systems aboard an arc ship heading toward a destination that hasn't been revealed yet. The mysterious captain of the ship has been completely overtaken by some sort of virus that's caused large growths to encapsulate his body. Somehow he's been kept alive by the ship's cryogenic systems. Volyova is doing her best to understand the virus that's brought him to death's door.</p>

<p>Finally there's an assassin named Ana Khouri who has been hired to assassinate Sylveste. Only time will tell how that turns out.</p>

<p>Like I said, there's a lot going on. I like that sort of thing, even if it can get a little confusing at times. Hopefully he doesn't add any more plotlines because I may just get overwhelmed.</p>
