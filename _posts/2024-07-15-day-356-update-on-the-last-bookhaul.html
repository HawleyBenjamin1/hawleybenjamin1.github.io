<p>So, I checked my order this weekend, and it turns out that a few days after I paid for the books I wanted, the money was returned to my account. Checking the order on thriftbooks revealed that it was actually cancelled because two of the books I ordered went out of stock ... after I ordered them. Not sure how that works, but yeah. That's why I didn't get my books for a week and a half. Anyway, I ordered a copy of 'The Chinese Groove,' which I need for my next book club meeting, but I guess I'll just have to wait for the other two. </p>

<p>There will be less than a week for me to read 'The Chinese Groove' by the time it gets here. My first thought was, 'there's always the library!' but when I checked, I found out I'd have to have it ordered even if I reserve it! They share books between locations. I guess all the copies got snatched up by other members of the club, so, I'm kinda stuck. Usually I don't like to read fast, but this time I'll just have to speed through it. At least it'll be fresh for the club meeting.</p>
