<p>I forgot to do my progress update yesterday! Well to be honest, there's not much of an update this week so maybe that's why.</p>

<p>I'm still struggling with 'A Tale of Two Cities' and Dicken's writing style, plus some of the locations are a bit confusing. He takes his time describing everything in great detail, but often those descriptions end up in metaphorical territory, but the imagery he uses for metaphor is also described in detail, so I'm finding it's pretty easy to get lost. </p>

<p>Oneiromancer is coming along, though my word count is still inconsistent since I took that break. Terrible idea apparently. I'm going to focus everything on getting the word count back up so I may have to make short blog posts for next week just to give myself more time. I almost have the retrospective post complete, something I've been working on this week. It will be posted either Monday or Tuesday. In short, I'm happy with the past 45 days of the blog so far, but there are some details I need to work on that I'll cover in the post. </p>
