<p>Things are coming along with the novel, but the short story I sent off a while ago was unfortunately rejected. I'll just have to keep sending stuff out until something sticks I guess, but it really is a drag. In his book 'On Writing' Stephen King said he used a spike that he mounted on the wall to impale every single one of his rejection letters, leaving them there as a reminder. I imagine that would be quite satisfying, but nobody uses paper anymore, so going all Vlad the Impaler on my PC probably wouldn't help anybody. I wonder if he still has that spike somewhere? </p>
