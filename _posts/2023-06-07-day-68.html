<p>Today I'm finishing up the 'middle point' of my book. I say that in quotes because it's not actually in the middle, though I wanted it to be. It's the bottom of the hero's arc, or the mirror moment if you read James Scott Bell's take on the structure of stories. It is the lowest point for the main character, but also the part where the most character growth happens. The decisions she makes after this will determine whether she was actually able to grow and learn something or not. Unfortunately, it ended up at a wonky point in the book and its going to make pacing very difficult. I might have to restructure the first half just to make sure it comes a little sooner to ensure more time is spent on the second half of the book. I should be able to finish within the word count I was aiming for, but this will be a big speedbump during editing. Fortunately for me, this will be a series of three books, and (in my opinion) in a series each individual book can have a little leeway on the structure as long as the story is complete by the end of the last book. I'd like to get the margin for error as small as possible though. Looks like I have my work cut out for me.</p>
