<p>I know it's been a long time coming, but I think I'm finally, finally getting to the end of editing 'Jeffries.' I did a read through today and didn't feel the need to change much, which is a nice feeling. There's one more scene I want to work in. I know I keep saying that. But this time it really is the last one. The previous last scene ended up spiraling into three separate scenes, but that's always how it is. I'm very close to done. It's not perfect, but the only way to make it any better would be to gut the entire ending and start over, and honestly? If I don't do this at some point it will never be finished. I'm gonna finish this last scene, do one more editing pass, and then call it quits on 'Jeffries.' After that, I'll seek to get it published as is. If it's not good enough for trad publishing in a magazine or on it's own, I'll just publish it myself as a standalone on Amazon.</p>

<p>Then all I have to do is decide what to write next!</p>
