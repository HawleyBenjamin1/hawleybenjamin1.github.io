<p>Man progress has been slow the past couple of weeks. I rounded out the poems I want to submit for the Tom Howard/Margaret Reid poetry competition but that's about it. The 'short' story I'm working on is still dragging on. I really need to figure out a way to predict the length of these stories more accurately. I didn't expect it to go further than 10,000 words, but now I'm at more than double that. I won't even be able to submit this stupid thing at this rate, it's just too long. I'm not sure what to do other than finish it off and leave it be for a while just to get back on track with Oneiromancer. I took a break from it to write this story but now I've started editing Oneiromancer again cause I got fed up writing the other story. It's all backwards. </p>

<p>At least it's almost done. I'll add a few more scenes and then call it quits. Then I can get back to rounding out the novel. I had several ideas for improvement over the past month of writing something else which gives me quite a bit of material to work with, so there's that. </p>
