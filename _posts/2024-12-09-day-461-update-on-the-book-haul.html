<p>Oh man, I got a little carried away today and almost forgot to make a blog post. Sometimes I get all my words out and it feels like I did it already. Weird. </p>

<p>Anyway, I started on a new series of books that I want to talk about in tomorrow's post. I was going to do a first impressions on the second editing book, but I realized it would have read exactly the same as the first book about editing. The tips and tricks are pretty much all identical so far. I'm still going to review the book when I finish with it, but I'm not sure how useful it will be to anybody who reads the blog. These books are weirdly similar, almost as if they were a colab or something. The other book, a collection of essays, should be suitably interesting though.</p>
