<p>I hope everybody gets some good scares tonight. The neighbors have already gotten me once or twice, and my mom always loves to decorate for Halloween. This year was no different. I'll let the results speak for themselves! </p>

<p>I love the Harry Potter theme! That screen in the picture frame showed the entire first movie on a loop, and just out of sight is a mandrake plant that screams when you grab it. Not very many trick-or-treaters came out this year, so I think posting it to the blog should get the setup some more well-deserved attention! Love ya mom, and Happy Halloween!</p>
