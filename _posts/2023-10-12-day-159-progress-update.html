<p>The grind continues as usual. I've edited several recent chapters while thinking about the next step, started what I think will be the next to last chapter in the first draft, and made some notes for when I start the first real edit. There's a lot to adjust. The thing fear most is reading it all back and not really caring about any of it. I imagine this is what a lot of authors hate to see. A story where none of it really matters or moves you. It'll probably take a lot of work in editing to make it do that well, but I need it to at least do that a little bit so I have something to work with. If it doesn't at all ... well I don't know what I'll do. Hopefully it doesn't come to that.</p>
