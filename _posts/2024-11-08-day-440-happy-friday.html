<p>I don't have much to write about today, so I guess I'll just say happy Friday everyone. All was much the same today as it was in my last progress update, and I don't have any pressing thoughts to get out. I'm going to try to finish 'The Cuckoo's Calling' over the weekend and get a review out on Monday. It's been a bit of a slog and I can't seem to get to a point where I really enjoy it so I think I'm just going to sit down and read it through so I can move on to the next one.</p>
