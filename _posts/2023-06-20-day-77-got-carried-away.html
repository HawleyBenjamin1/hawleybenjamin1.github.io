<p>Agh, I got so carried away editing a story that I missed the submission time by like two and a half hours! I did finish the story and send it off for review, so my day has been productive, but I'm kicking myself for missing the window. I should probably set up a pre-submission that will always trigger at 1PM the next day so I don't forget to submit again. Today's post has been moved to tomorrow because I got carried away with the other thing, so I'll tide you over with some details about the story I wrote.</p>

<p>The Shaft is a short story about a mountaineer who goes looking for his life's purpose in a strange rock formation, and finds himself unable to resist going deeper. It's about the lengths people will go to in order to find purpose in a purposeless world. I'm trying to get this one published, so I can't really publish it here right now, but if nobody wants it in the next month or two I'll go ahead and post it here. It's a pretty dark tale, so I submitted it to The Dark Magazine, which you should definitely give a read if you're into horror stories.</p>
