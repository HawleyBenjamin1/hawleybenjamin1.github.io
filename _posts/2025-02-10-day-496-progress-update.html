<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm up late on a Monday again. Yesterday I submitted to the latest writing battle and I think I used up a lot of my brain power. Today I haven't been able to write much of anything. Weird how it comes and goes.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I think I'm going to spend some more time on the blog, and start working on a new book haul. It's been a while since I've had one, but I've been trying not to break the bank lately so there's been good reason. My next book haul is going to focus on more modern titles, but this time I'm going to look for some good ones dang it. My last experiment with contemporary books was not very good, with the exception of discovering Abraham Verghese, who blew everybody else I read out of the water. I want to find some modern sci-fi titles to read, maybe some fantasy too. It'll be like getting back to my roots. Some of the first books I remember reading were sci-fi/fantasy published almost the same year I read them. Should be fun!</p>
