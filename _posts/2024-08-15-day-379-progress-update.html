<p>Not much to report this week. Still working on the new sci-fi story's first draft which should be finished up by Monday. Then I'll see where it stands in a couple weeks with fresh eyes while continuing to edit Oneiromancer. </p>

<p>I'll also be reviewing 'Forge of God' soon, but I'm not sure what to think overall yet. It's been a slow week as far as progress goes so it'll probably be out Tuesday or Wednesday next week.</p>
