<p>I found this neat audio series called <a href="https://bluemarblestorytellers.com/crossroads-cantina-2/">Crossroads Cantina from Blue Marble Story Tellers</a> and wanted to share it with the blog. The concept is that the Crossroads Cantina lies at the crossroads of all sorts of different stories, told by those who visit the tavern. I love this idea and after listening to a couple of the short stories hosted there, I would be so happy if they accepted one of mine. Unfortunately, I can't find a submissions page on their website! It's very frustrating when this happens.</p>

<p>Thankfully another group has a related submission going on right now for an anthology called the <a href="https://wolfgrove.media/book-of-choices">'Book of Choices'</a> which you can find at the link there. It's based on one of the cantina stories wherein a cursed book, activated by blood falling on its pages, offers the reader a choice, usually with devastating consequences. This has generated all kinds of ideas for me. I used to be obsessed with the 'would you rather' game when I was young, so this is right up my alley. Hopefully they like what I have to send them, I'd be so happy to be published in their book of choices.</p>
