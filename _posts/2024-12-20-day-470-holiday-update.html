<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I decided to take next week off. Last year I basically half-assed it through the holidays, and the posts got understandably little traction anyway with holidays on. I figure Christmas and New Years are best spent with the family (or partying). The next post will be in 2025 ... a year that has always sounded like a year that would be in the future to me. I guess it's already here. </p>

<p>Anyway, happy holidays everyone!</p>
