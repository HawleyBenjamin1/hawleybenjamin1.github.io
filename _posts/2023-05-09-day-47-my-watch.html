<p>I'm trundling along doing my best to get good quality writing down. These next blog posts will probably be more off the cuff seeing as I haven't prewritten anything, but I'm still going to make them to help keep my thoughts in order while writing. That was the original purpose of the blog, though I drifted away from that so I could write better quality posts. That quality will hopefully be reflected in the primary writing instead, which I am focusing my hardest on . I even got up early this morning. I don't know why or how so it probably won't ever happen again. </p>

<p>With the extra time, I read one of my favorite Twain stories. It's called 'My Watch' and it's about a man who takes his perfect watch in to set the time only for the watchmaker to ruin it beyond repair. It never works quite the same way after being 'repaired,' and Twain makes quite the lesson out of it. Even so-called experts can break something forever by meddling with it. In other words, if ain't broke, don't fix it.</p>
