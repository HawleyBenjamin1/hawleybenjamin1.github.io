<p>It was a sad day today. I drove over to see my grandparents and help bury their cat, Finn. They got him back in 2012 along with two other cats, Jack and Jill, who have been a fixture in their house ever since. Finn was laid to rest right alongside the other family pets buried on the property in good company. I'm sure he will be sorely missed. </p>

<p>Here's a favorite of my grandfather's, a picture he took of Finn with his brother Jack in the background, looking as if he has two heads.</p>
