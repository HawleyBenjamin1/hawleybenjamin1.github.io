<p>It's a rare sight to see February 29 in my calendar. I think this year I'll be celebrating by forgetting all about the leap year phenomenon tomorrow and for the next four years also. That way it can be just as much of a novelty next time it comes around. I don't think I'll be able to do anything else besides to be honest. </p>
