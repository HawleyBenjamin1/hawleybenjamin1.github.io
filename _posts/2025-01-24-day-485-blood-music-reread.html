<p>It's still too cold to do anything enjoyable outside, so I spent all of yesterday rereading one of my favorite sci-fi novels, 'Blood Music' by Greg Bear. I don't usually reread books, but this one is an exception. Here are my thoughts on a second look:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>First of all, it is a really quick read. This time it went by even faster than first read, and I think I love that about the book. It's just so dense. There's not a lot of traditional action scenes, but that doesn't prevent the book from feeling action packed because so much is going on all the time. I think this book really lends itself to a reread because of that.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the characters stuck out to me as kinda thin on the second pass. They're probably the weakest aspect of the book, and maybe Bear's writing in general. I got the same feeling from 'The Forge of God.' The characters aren't weak or unbelievable, it's just that they feel more like slaves to the plot than actors themselves. A lot of the characters have their problems resolved unsatisfactorily in my opinion. It may just be because both of the books I've read from Bear have been disaster stories though. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The last third of the book I just kinda wanted to be over with. It makes an even bigger departure from the characters I was interested in to focus more on what's happening around the world. The appeal of this part of the novel is, well, the novelty, but on a second read it's just something that has to happen.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>The sci-fi elements still hold up extremely well on second viewing. Bear clearly did a ton of research into molecular biology. The best class I ever took was a molecular genetics course that taught me all about how DNA gets transcribed into proteins and structures that build the cell and make life what it is. There's no other sci-fi that goes quite as in depth as 'Blood Music' into this topic as far as I'm aware. Bear's exploration of these concepts is very well-done, and doesn't get in the way of the plot for exposition's sake either. Rereading about main character Vergil's process for creating a computer system within the structure of DNA was the highlight of the book for me. It's so convincing it feels like it should be doable in real life. </p>

<p>I'm happy to say I still love the book. I'm always afraid to go back and reread or rewatch something and find I've grown too much to like it anymore. I don't think I'll ever outgrow 'Blood Music' though.</p>
