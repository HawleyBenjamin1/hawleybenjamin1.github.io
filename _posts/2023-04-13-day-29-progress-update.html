<p>Its been a week since my last progress update, and I can hardly believe how the time flies. Feels like just yesterday I was telling everybody I was about to take a year off to do what<em> I</em> want to do for a while. Its been a month and a half, and in that time I've written about 11,000 words on Oneiromancer, plus I finished off two short stories, and of course I've been keeping up with the blog. I would like to increase that word count, since I don't think 11,000 in a month and a half is going to be enough to finish the book any time soon. Other than that, I think I've made decent progress. </p>

<p>I want to do something a little special for post number 30, but I'm not sure what exactly. I've been wanting to review a series that's close to my heart called Worm, but it needs a reread before I give it a go. I read that Wool review back over and ugh. It really didn't make much of a point. I think my initial instinct to review recently read material is the right way to go, so I probably won't be doing that again any time soon. As I mentioned yesterday, I'm currently reading Brave New World, and that's only the second in the book haul, so the Worm reread will have to wait. Worm is also a million and a half words ... Not sure I have time for that right now with all that I want to read. </p>

<p>Today's post is a short one, but if you'd like to read more, I posted a response to a writing prompt on reddit that I'd be happy for you to check out. Looks like putting a link here will work, but let me know in the comments if you can't read the post below after clicking on view the conversation.</p>
