<p>Only two days to go before I finally hear back from a competition I entered three months ago. It took me a month to write the story too, so I've been thinking about this for a long time. The Book of Choices Anthology is having <a href="https://wolfgrove.media/book-of-choices">a competition that you can check out here</a>, one which I've talked about before at length. Come Monday I'll have my final update on this competition, win or lose. All this waiting has left me pretty excited to find out what's going to happen. Not sure if they did that on purpose, but it's certainly working in their favor now. Best of luck to everyone, I'm sure all the stories that end up in the anthology will be a great read. I'm looking forward to reading them just as much.</p>
