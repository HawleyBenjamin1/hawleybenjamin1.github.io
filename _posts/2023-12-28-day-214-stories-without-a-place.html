<p>Sometimes I'll write a short story that just ends up in my completed folder gathering dust. They're stories with odd word counts, stories that defy genre, shrug off stylistic requirements, or otherwise seem unpublishable. They're just kinda there. I have one right now that I've been trying to find a publication to submit to for months, but there don't seem to be any. It's short enough to be flash fiction, kinda fits into sci-fi but not really, and has a weird bit of rhyming in there that makes it half-poem, half-story. I think it's good, but there's just nowhere to submit that kind of thing. I don't really want to post it here though because if I did find a place for it then I'd be kicking myself for having self published it. Feels like I'm caught between a rock and a hard place with this one. I guess there will always be some pieces of our work that won't really be for anybody else. </p>
