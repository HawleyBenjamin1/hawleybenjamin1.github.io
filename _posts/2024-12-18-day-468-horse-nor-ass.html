<p>Today was one of those days where I just couldn't seem to get much done. I barely even read any of 'Editors on Editing' so I'll have to save my first impressions post for tomorrow. It's been pretty good so far, but I haven't sunk my teeth into it yet. The reason being, I have to admit, is that I got distracted by a rabbit hole again. For some reason I started to wonder about that saying, 'To err is human,' and where it came from, so I looked it up and couldn't stop reading. It comes from a poem called 'An Essay on Criticism,' and though it's one of Alexander Pope's best known works, I think it's so good it might still be under-referenced somehow. Throughout part one, Pope shares his unapologetic thoughts on literary critics, with a healthy dose of criticism of his own. I mean just read this banger of a stanza where he talks about the types of people who can pass for poets and critics:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>Some have at first for wits then poets passed<br />Turned critics next and proved plain fools at last<br />Some neither can for wits nor critics pass<br />As heavy mules are neither horse nor ass.<br />Those half-learned witlings, numerous in our isle,<br />As half-formed insects on the banks of Nile<br />Unfinished things one knows not what to call<br />Their generation is so equivocal<br />To tell them would a hundred tongues require,<br />Or one vain wits that might a hundred tire.</em></p>

<p>I guess they didn't mince words back in the day because damn. I've never felt like being horse nor ass is a bad thing, but now I'm wondering if I even qualify as anything other than a heavy mule. </p>

<p>Anyway I should probably get back on it tomorrow, but this was just too funny to pass up.</p>
