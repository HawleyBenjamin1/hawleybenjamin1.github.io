<p>Hey, I seem to have hit another milestone! 450 days ain't half bad. I missed posting one day in all that time (or was it two? I can't quite recall if I missed another one). Only fifty more posts to go before I get to five hundred. I was feeling like it wasn't that long ago that I started this whole project, but then I went back and read some of the first posts I did, and yeah. It's been a long time. I've learned a lot, done a lot of practice, reading, and even some socializing along the way. This has been a great journey and I'm so happy I got to take it on when I did. I'm sure I will come back and read some of these later in life and be pleased that I was able to keep a record all this time, even I might cringe over some of the writing. </p>
