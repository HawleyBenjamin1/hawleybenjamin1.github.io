<p>I don't have much to say today beyond the title. I hope everybody enjoys their long weekend and has a memorable Memorial Day. It feels weird reading Dracula today when I just finished a war novel not too long ago. Maybe that review would have been a bit more poignant today, even it was about the Spanish Civil War. Leveraging a holiday made for someone else for personal gain might feel a little weird though, so I'm happy to just wish everybody a good Memorial Day instead. </p>
