<p>The first Monday of the year has me back to regularly scheduled programming. Unfortunately, I had planned on sharing the first deployed version of my new site today, but every time I think I've finally got it working, something else is wrong. It's been quite the learning process (and something of a headache) but I'm steadily approaching a useable state. Any day now ... any day. </p>

<p>I haven't done much else besides edit up a couple of poems I had written a long time ago and pretty much forgotten about. They weren't too bad, so I think I'll find a place to submit them if I can. There's this one big magazine called Poetry Magazine that pays incredibly well, but of course that means huge competition ... and an insane response time EIGHT MONTHS. I've never seen any publisher take that long, but I suppose it makes sense when there are hundreds of thousands of poems submitted each year. The best option is probably just to publish elsewhere, although that $10 per line is still pretty tempting. </p>
