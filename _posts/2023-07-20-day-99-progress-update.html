<p>So after writing a couple chapters, and editing down a few other chapters, I'm at about 98,000 total words for Oneiromancer. Last time I posted the word count I believe it was at about 90,000, so not too much progress since, but I'm in a forgiving mood for myself since a lot of what I write actually doesn't make it to the main file. I like to split off my chapters into individual documents so I can edit them separately and stack them up in order later. I find that I end up deleting bad material or making big changes quite often and this helps me keep track of things. I also quickly summarize every chapter at the top of the file so no matter how long it is between edits, I can know immediately what the overarching goal of the chapter is and how it connects to the next chapter. I mention these things because it actually makes it kinda hard to calculate my word count accurately if I haven't added all the chapters to the main file yet. Not that the word count matters terribly much, as long as I'm working on it consistently that is. When I started I was aiming for word goals because X words a day for Y weeks equals a novel in a certain amount of time, right? Boy was I wrong. Sometimes all my material is good and I get 1000s of words out that fit right into the story. Sometimes I get 1000s of words that just plain suck, and those are never added. All that being said, I think it would be really cool if I could hit 100,000 on day 100, so I'm going to see if I can squeeze out those last 2000 words today. Wish me luck!</p>
