<p>Raleigh has gotten some snow for the first time in 2025! It'll be just for tonight, and there's really not much, but I'm happy to see some snow out of my back window. Somehow it makes all the winter trees look a little more alive. My house never feels quite as cozy as when there's a snowfall outside either, and a little hot chocolate in my mug of course. It's a lot of fun to just sit and admire the outdoors for a while ... as long as I don't have to go out in it that is.</p>
