<p>I just finished judging my first round of writing battle submissions and it was a lot of fun. The stories were better than I was expecting and I thought both participants did a great job. I can't mention any specifics, but the genre I was judging for was 'aliens.' I love aliens in fiction and the responses were both creative and fun so I couldn't really ask for more. The feedback system on the website is really straightforward and I can't wait to read my own when the round is finished. I'm sure it'll be helpful. </p>

<p>I read my submission back and on a second look, I don't think it's very good. The pacing is kinda off and the subject matter is not my usual cup of tea, but I was feeling adventurous while writing. Hopefully its clunkiness isn't held against me too badly. That three day time limit is brutal! I don't think I'll win, but I'm sure to get some good feedback.</p>
