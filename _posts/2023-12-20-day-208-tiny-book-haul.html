<p>It's almost the end of the year. 2024 is approaching rapidly and I think I have time to squeeze in one more book. This year I've read the most books I have since grade school, so why not push for one last addition to cap off the holiday season? Now I've just got to decide what I want to read ... This is kinda like when you sit down to watch something on Netflix for the night and realize that an hour has passed but you still haven't picked anything and now a movie is out of the question because you'll have to go to bed soon. In the interest of getting started sooner than later, this year's final book haul (with a grand total of one book) will be ... drum roll ... dramatic pause ...</p>

<p>'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' by Phillip K. Dick! </p>

<p>I've been wanting to read one of his novels for a long time, and I feel like this one is a great place to start, what with it being an absolute classic and all. Plus it will give me an excuse to watch 'Blade Runner' again immediately afterward. Not that I really needed one. Look forward to that review sometime around New Years, and by then I'll have a more complete book haul to kick off 2024 with as well.</p>
