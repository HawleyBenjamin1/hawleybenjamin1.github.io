<p>Happy Fourth everyone. I don't do much to celebrate myself other than get together with family and maybe watch some fireworks. This time around I'm spending it with some good friends. I hope everyone else gets the privilege to do the same. </p>

<p>Maybe it goes without saying, but if you're one of those who gets into it enough to set of some fireworks yourself, please try not to lose any fingers. Remember, alcohol and explosives rarely mix well, plus, nothing good ever happens after 2 A.M. This has been a public service announcement.</p>
