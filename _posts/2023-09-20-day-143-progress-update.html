<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It's been a slow week for me and I feel I haven't been able to focus very well. I'm going to try to pull the word count up this second half of the week as much as I can. I'm gonna try to keep the posts short and sweet for the next couple of days. My brain is all too happy to distract itself with writing long posts about paragraphs rather than writing the thing I told it to write. I do enjoy writing for the blog, just maybe a little too much sometimes.</p>
