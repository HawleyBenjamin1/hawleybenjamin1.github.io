<p>Oops, almost missed the blog post today. I got carried away I guess. I've had a really strong session today and I think I can continue the momentum. I finished editing a poem, got almost 2500 words down on Jeffries, and weirdly enough, it didn't even feel like much effort. Sometimes, the words just flow. I wish they did this all the time.</p>

<p>I should be getting my books in tomorrow. Expect a first impressions post by Friday, and a review in the next week or two depending on which book I decide to read. Also, I've run out of shelf space for all my books. I'm going to have to get a new one, and if it looks good when I get it all set up I might post a picture. No promises though!</p>
