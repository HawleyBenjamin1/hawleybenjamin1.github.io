<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I've been focused more on trying to get my name out there this week, letting the next chapter in Oneiromancer brew a little before continuing. I did some social media posts, wrote several smaller pieces for some writing competitions, worked on a short story I have brewing, and submitted a few others I already had finished for publication. Fingers crossed one of the stories in this batch gets published! </p>

<p>Today's the day for me to get back to Oneiromancer and I think I'm ready for this next part now. It's a big moment that I've been leading up to, so I hope I can do it justice. Wish me luck.</p>
