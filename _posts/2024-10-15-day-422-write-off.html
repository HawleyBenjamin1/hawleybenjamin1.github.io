<p>I haven't been able to focus at all today. I've got like four trains of thought all traveling parallel to one another and a song stuck in my head to boot. It's not good. Usually if I just sit down and write whatever random thoughts come to mind for a while the problem goes away, but I've been sitting here trying to get started for hours. It's weird how the brain just won't do what you want it to do sometimes. I wonder what makes this happen? I mean besides dain bramage. It's hard not to write off days like this one. No pun intended.</p>

<p>Anyway, I got few thoughts down on 'Jeffries.' I only have one scene to go! And then I can focus on something else. I think I'll finish of the first round of edits on my book, and hopefully have some thoughts along the way about what to write next. Then I'll edit the crap out of Jeffries. I should be able to remove a couple thousand words at least. My goal is to get it under 30k words, and right now it's sitting at 32k. Shouldn't be too tough, this last scene will be a short one ... although, those do sound like some famous last words if ever I've heard them.</p>
