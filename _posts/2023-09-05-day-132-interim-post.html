<p>I've started my next book, 'Timeline,' but I don't know what to make of it yet. It hasn't grabbed me quite like 'Jurassic Park' did, but I guess it's pretty hard to top the results of a raptor attack as far as opening scenes go. I don't have much else to report, so I guess this blog will have to be a short one. Just the same old, same old for today. I plan on doing a first impressions for 'Timeline' tomorrow, and then I think I'm going to work on a nice big post for Thursday or Friday, something in the same vein as my megastructures or interstellar travel post. Those are really fun to write but they do require a bit more effort. I'm thinking that an exploration of the super suit / power armor trope could be interesting. There are all kinds of Iron Man style exosuits in fiction, but I wonder where that idea first started? The earliest instance I've seen was in 'Starship Troopers,' but I don't think the idea is really such a big leap from non-mechanized armor, and people have been wearing that stuff for thousands of years. Maybe there was an earlier iteration. Does magic armor granted by the gods count? <a href="https://digitalmapsoftheancientworld.com/mythology/greek-mythology/mythical-creatures/automatons/#:~:text=The%20Automatons%20were%20animate%2C%20metal,crafted%20by%20the%20god%20Hephaestus.&amp;text=They%20were%20four%20horse%2Dshaped,chariot%20of%20his%20Cabeiri%20sons.">Huge, mechanized automatons</a> were present in Greek myth, but I don't know if mechanized armor was. I guess I'll have to do some research. </p>
