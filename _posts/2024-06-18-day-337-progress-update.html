<p>Editing has been going surprisingly well lately. I'm about halfway through my book now, at least by word count that is. I think I need to do a little restructuring to get the halfway point of the story right in the middle of the book. It's not a huge priority right now, but it would be nice to have it symmetrical. I imagine it could feel a little strange if the second half of the story is larger than the second half of the book.</p>

<p>If you're confused about how that could be possible, I'm basing the structure of the novel on James Scott Bell's mirror moment structure. <a href="https://www.septembercfawkes.com/2020/12/understanding-mirror-moment.html">Read about it here, it's a very straightforward way to structure a story.</a> Essentially there is a point of no return where the hero must decide who they want to become based on who they've been so far in the story. If I have too much plot left to cover after that moment then the whole thing will seem lopsided.</p>

<p>Anyway I'm happy it's going smoothly. I think it will be that way for a while, up until the last third of the book where things got a little rocky for me when I was writing the first draft. I'll have to do some serious reworking then. For now I'm just going to enjoy the smooth sailing.</p>
