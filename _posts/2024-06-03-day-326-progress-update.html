<p>Editing is picking up a little. I finally got to a point in the book where I semi-sorta knew what I was doing. I think this was the point where, by then, I had read a couple of fiction writing books, and taken a course in college. The line to line writing seems to be improving, but I'm not sure how well the whole thing will tie together in the end. It will make it quite a bit easier to cover more ground without having to fix every single sentence though. This should be closer to editing than the rewriting I've been doing, at least for a while. Near the end of the novel I think I'll have to make some larger changes that will require a lot of restructuring to fit the narrative. Specifically there's an sequence of events in the third part of the novel I want to completely rewrite. That should be fun. And probably really time consuming.</p>
