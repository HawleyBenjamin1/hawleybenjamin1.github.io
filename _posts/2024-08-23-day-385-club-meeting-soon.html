<p>I have another book club meeting on Monday but I read the book, 'Beartown,' almost two months ago now. I took some time today to skim over my favorite parts and man, I need to finish this series. Backman's style is so good I don't know how he isn't more popular. I'm definitely going to binge read the next book in the series this weekend. I'll just have to resist spoiling the rest for everybody at the club!</p>
