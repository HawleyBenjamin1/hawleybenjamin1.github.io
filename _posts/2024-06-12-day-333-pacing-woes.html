<p>The general writing level of my book has improved now that I'm past page 100, but there's one thing that definitely has not. The pacing of my book is not very good. Probably because there's so little down time that the reader (or in this case, the editor) has no time whatsoever to think about what's going on. In a book with some complicated stuff going on, it's a big problem. For the next week or so I'm going to be researching the best ways to improve my pacing. I already have some ideas, but man does it need work. Hopefully I can get it figured out sooner rather than later because reediting all this to improve pacing is going to suck really hard if I don't get the broad strokes right. Wish me luck!</p>
