<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Today I'm doing an experiment. Usually I write after eating at least a snack, but today I decided to write while hungry to see what happens. I got the idea from Hemingway's 'A Moveable Feast' where he talks about how Paris was the kind of city that always made you hungry. Drifting scents from the bakeries and cafes would follow him around as he walked. He said in the book that he always liked to get the day's work over with before eating very much. Then again, every other scene had him writing in a cafe with something to nibble on. Maybe there was a bit of selective memory going on or something. Whatever the case, I'm trying it out today to see what happens. It's already been a struggle to get started, but hey, maybe it'll enhance the speed of my writing just by giving me some motivation to get it over with and go get some food. Either that, or I'll end up writing about food a lot more ...</p>
