<p>Sometimes I like turn ordinary things into extraordinary things by changing my perspective on them. It helps me write about 'dull' stuff in new ways, but also it's just plain fun. Until it goes too far that is. </p>

<p>I was thinking about how extraordinary the Sun is despite so many people barely giving it a second glace every day. It kinda freaks me out that there's an incomprehensibly large fusion dynamo in the sky that's been there longer than the Earth has been around, and will be there long after. It's really no wonder people worshipped the Sun for so long. If you look at it too long, you'll go blind. Standing beneath it can burn you so bad your skin will peel off and you'll later get cancer. If you put plants underneath it, they grow, and if it's gone for too long, the plants will all die. It brings both life and death to every corner of the planet and demands utmost respect by nature of its sheer power. In other words, it fits every criterion for an actual god. Plus it's just sitting there. Menacingly. </p>
