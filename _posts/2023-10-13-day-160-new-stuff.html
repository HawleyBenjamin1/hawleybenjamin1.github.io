<p>I've been thinking about how to spend that prize money from the competition I mentioned earlier in the week. It would seem most prudent to get something to help me write, so the obvious solution is a new keyboard. I've been doing some digging though, and this is turning out to be a huge field with way too many options. There's full size, tenkeyless, 75%, 65%, 60%, mechanical vs membrane, lighting options from backlit all the way to full rainbow RGB nonsense, and that isn't even considering the build quality of different brands, keys, and switches. I'm so overwhelmed but it's also kinda awesome. </p>

<p>If any keyboard enthusiasts in the comments have some suggestions for a solid option that doesn't make too much noise, let me know in the comments.</p>
