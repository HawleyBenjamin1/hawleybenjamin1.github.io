<p>The past week's posts have all been topical and haven't included any updates, so today's post is going to cover what I've been working on since the previous update. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>First of all, I updated my writing goal because I wasn't able to meet 2000 words a day. I set it back to 1000, and so far that's been a good goal to hit most days. It's not easy but not terribly difficult so I'm going to stick with it for a while. I would like to get more of those words directly into my work in progress though, so that'll be my focus next week. I find myself able to write a lot more for random short stories and ideas I want to try out than for my work in progress itself. In fact, whenever I write for a writing prompt or a new idea I blow through the writing goal and then some, but my work in progress is much slower going. I'm not sure what the solution is, maybe I need to spend more time considering exactly what I want to write to make things go smoothly.</p>

<p>I'm almost finished reviewing Frankenstein, so that will be going up tomorrow. I'm not sure what I expected going in exactly, but whatever it was, the book was not that, because every other chapter had me guessing what would happen next. It was a great book and I'm looking forward to finishing off the review. </p>

<p>Another part of the day job I got started on was finding a writing group. This has proved to be harder than expected. There are lots of posts looking for groups in places like r/WritingHub on reddit, but none of them seem to respond. I guess I'll just have to keep trying until I find one eventually. I need a beta reader for Demonetization, which I've edited about as much as possible. I'd like to get some feedback from a third party and then do one more round of editing before submitting it anywhere. Hopefully taking into account a few readers' opinions will increase my chances of getting it published.</p>

<p>Well, that's about all I've been working on. Expect the Frankenstein review tomorrow, and maybe another update on the writing group front if I can find one.</p>
