<p>Short post today everybody. I'm trying to get a lot done on Oneiromancer right now, and I haven't finalized my thoughts about The Forever War, so I don't have much to give for the blog at the moment. Tomorrow I'll have the review up and then I can start on the next book, Beloved by Toni Morrison. I'm excited to start that one because I've heard such great things. I don't have much else to say today, and so I'll just bid everyone a good Monday for now (if such a thing exists). </p>
