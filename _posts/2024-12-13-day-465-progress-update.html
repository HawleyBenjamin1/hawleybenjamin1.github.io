<p>I did a lot of reading this week, but not as much writing as I'd hoped. I have one of the two scenes I wanted to add to 'Jeffries' ready to go, still working on the other. Other than that, there's not much else to report. Come Monday I'll have a review ready for 'Jade City' and I'll have started on 'Editors on Editing,' which I hope is as interesting as I suspect it will be. </p>

<p>Christmas is right around the corner. The blog may take a bit of a back seat to all the festivities, but I should be able to keep up with it as the holidays pick up steam. I might even do some Christmas themed posts! </p>
