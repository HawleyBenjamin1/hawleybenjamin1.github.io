<p>If you tried to access the new blog site today and couldn't, it's because I took it down. It was ugly and didn't deserve a deployment, but hey, I got a little ahead of myself in my excitement. Since yesterday I've made a few adjustments, done some work to get it right, and I finally have the template up and running as it should be, styling and all. You still won't be able to access it but at least it's working. Now I'm to the task of importing all my existing posts ... Should be a piece of cake, right?</p>

<p>In other news, I submitted some poetry to a couple of different publishers for review. Hopefully I'll hear back soon. I'm still waiting to hear back from the last round of poetry submissions I did almost four months ago now. It's hard not to lose hope on the ones that I never even hear back about honestly. Between submissions, the stuff I'm writing, and the blog site itself, I'm starting to think this whole writing thing demands a lot of patience. I wish someone had told me that going in. </p>
