<p>Went to a book club meeting tonight and realized I read the wrong book! Instead of the current meeting's book, I accidentally read the book we're looking at in two months time. Whoops. At least I'm ahead of the game, but now I'll probably have to reread just to be on the same page as everybody else. Silly me. </p>

<p>Thankfully I've realized the mistake and I'm back on track. Now I'll be reading 'The Chinese Groove' for the next meeting, which I made doubly sure is the right book. As far as book hauls go I'm not sure this really counts, seeing as it's only the one. That said, I think I need to do another book haul soon so I don't run out of stuff to read. Those last few I got were all excellent books, well written, ingeniously creative, but also slow reads. Coming to grips with the myriad of novel concepts peppered throughout 'Revelation Space' took me a particularly long time, especially since I hopped right into the sequel while reading 'Beartown' at the same time. Worth it though. Those are both great books.</p>

<p>Anyway, look forward to a book haul sometime this week. Maybe this haul's theme will be books you can find for dirt cheap. That would be nice.</p>
