<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The finals of the second Writing Battle I joined came back over the weekend. I didn't place at all, but I did have a few rounds go my way. It was fun, and the story was okay, so maybe I'll submit it elsewhere after some revisions.</p>

<p>A friend of mine who also joined the competition made it all the way to the finals though, and we were all excited for her at our writer's group meeting over the weekend. Our little group will take over Writing Battles if it's the last thing we do!</p>

<p>It was a lot of fun and I've already signed up for the next one in April. It's another pro-judged competition and I can't wait to get started on it!</p>
