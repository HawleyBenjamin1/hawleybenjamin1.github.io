<p>So I missed my deadline again (sigh), and I'm not going to set another one. Predicting when it'll be done is much harder than expected. I work on it daily and I guess that will have to be good enough. It'll be finished when it's finished and not a moment before I suppose. Maybe in the future I'll have enough experience under my belt to predict deadlines and hit them, but with this first novel I think it's best if I just write it and try not to worry too much about when I need it done by. That's the benefit of not having a publisher yet. I see lots of published authors struggling with this sort of thing, and they have heaps more pressure on them than I do, so I'm going to take advantage of the period where I don't yet have to worry too much. I'm still going to push myself to finish sooner rather than later of course, but I don't see the point in setting arbitrary deadlines that I will either miss or finish before. We'll see how it goes.</p>
