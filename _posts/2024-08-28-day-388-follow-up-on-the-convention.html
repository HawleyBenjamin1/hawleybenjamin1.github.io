<p>Yesterday I posted about a 'convention' I was heading to, only now I know it wasn't really a convention I signed up for. It was more of a talk? A social gathering? I'm not sure. It was in a conference room atop one of the tallest buildings in Raleigh. The view made me a little sick standing too close. I even got a picture.</p>

<p>Most of the time was spent letting everyone wander around and converse with one another, which I am not very good at, so it was a little awkward for me, but I met some cool people. I learned about a new place in Raleigh called <a href="https://beows.com/">Beow's Books &amp; Brews</a>, which is an epic business model that I've been looking for for years, even met the owner who was a nice guy. I also picked up a couple of books, both signed by the authors who were speaking that night. Once the panel actually started I was a lot more comfortable, and the speakers all had interesting things to say. One question in particular piqued my interest: </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>"What advice would you have for new authors trying to get their stories out there?"</em></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, the advice that all five of the panelists gave was the same. Go talk to a bunch of people and foist your books on them.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Ok, they didn't quite put it that way, but it's pretty much what they meant. It seems like being an author would be one of the few professions that let you get away with hiding in your room all the time, but no. I knew that already, but it hurts to have literally anybody who has ever sold a book tell you you have to interact with strangers on a near-daily basis to get anywhere in life when that's like your worst nightmare. </p>

<p><em>Sigh</em></p>

<p>It was fun though, and I'm glad I went. I think I'll try to find some more of these kinds of gatherings to attend. Here are links to the books I bought by the way, both local authors with stories centered in and around North Carolina.</p>
