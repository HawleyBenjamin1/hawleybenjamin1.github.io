<p>Just going to make a quick update today since I lost so much time yesterday with my internet down. I had to set my router up again today for some reason, and based on the number of default wifi names in my area, it looks like the rest of the neighborhood did as well. Not sure if it was the flickering power or the internet being down so long that did it, but it sure was weird to have wired internet working on my PC this morning without being able to find the wifi network I've been using for years. </p>

<p>I have five chapters written on my new book, but no title yet. I'll have to come up with something soon just so I can call it by name. It'll probably change by the time I'm done drafting it. I'm also coming up on almost a month since finishing my first draft of Oneiromancer. I think I'll start on the second draft sometime in February. Should be a busy month next month.</p>

<p>Speaking of, I've submitted four stories for publication in the last week, so hopefully I get some positive feedback on those. To keep up the trend I think I'm going to set a new goal of submitting one story a week as long as I have something in my backlog to work with. Getting them into publishable shape is a lot of work, but I should be able to do one per week for at least as long as I have something to edit. </p>
