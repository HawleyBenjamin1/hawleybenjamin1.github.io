<p>Happy Friday everybody! This is going to be a progress update about what I've written in the past week, and I'll see if I was able to keep to my word goals. I'll also be uploading a recently edited short story after this post, so keep an eye out for that if you're interested! The story is called Adrift, but I don't want to give anything away here, so I won't say any more before posting.</p>

<p>The major accomplishment this week was that I finished off an old short story I started a long time ago called Demonitization. It ended up at about 8000 words (pre-editing) and I wrote 5000 of those this week. I was also able to write 1000 words for Oneiromancer yesterday and finishing up editing the short story I'll be posting today, so all in all not a bad week if I say so myself. I wasn't able to make the word goal, but I wasn't too far off either. I got 6000 / 8000 across 4 days, so maybe I can pump out some extra today to get those numbers up. I'm so inconsistent day-to-day that I'm leaning toward using a weekly goal instead. A weekly average will be more useful to me than a bunch of daily word goals.</p>

<p>Everything I write today will be for Oneiromancer, since I've been neglecting it in favor of the short stories this week. I said I wanted to finish the draft by the end of Summer, but after doing the math I think I might be able to knock it out sooner than later. If I can stick to 2000 a day, that's 10,000 words per week, and I have approximately 15 weeks of Summer, plus whatever is left in spring, so I would be able to put out more than 150,000 words! There's a big if in keeping to the word goal though. And something tells me I won't be able to get all 150,000 into Oneiromancer, seeing as I spent most of this week writing and editing short stories. Still, if I can keep the pace up and write at least 75,000 for Oneiromancer then the first draft should be complete by then. I want to print it out on paper and hold it in my hands. I'll feel like I accomplished something, plus it'll make editing quite a bit more fun that way.  I'm certainly looking forward to it!</p>

<p>Today's post is a rather short one, so I'll go ahead and leave you to the rest of your day. Just a quick reminder to look out for my short story Adrift that I'll be posting soon.</p>
