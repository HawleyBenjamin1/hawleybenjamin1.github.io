<p>I've been working on a short story for a while that I just can't seem to get right. I edit and edit and edit, rewrite, rework the idea, do everything I can, but it just doesn't work. I don't know how to improve it any further, but it never feels quite good enough either. Putting it down is going to be difficult, but I guess if I can't improve it any further I'll just have to get over it. I've sent it out a few times for publication in a few different versions and yet, nothing. I know it takes years to get published. I know it's one of the hardest things you can do. I'm probably just being impatient, but sometimes it feels like it just won't happen. Maybe in a year or two I'll read that story back and realize exactly what it's missing and why, and make it right, but it feels like I won't be able to do that without getting something published first. It's such a catch 22. I don't know what my work is missing because I haven't written anything that's just right because I don't know what my work is missing. </p>

<p>Finding a good writing buddy to review my work is probably the only way to fix this issue, so I've been working to find someone who can help me improve. Hopefully I can get there soon. Not to whine too hard on the internet, but I'd really like to make some progress on this front because the feeling of spinning my wheels is killing my motivation. </p>
