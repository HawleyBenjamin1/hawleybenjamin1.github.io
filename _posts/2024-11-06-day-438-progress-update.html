<p>Well, it finally happened. I broke my streak of posting a blog post every week day. It made it 436 days, but I guess it had to happen at some point. I'll continue posting in the same order of days to maintain my ordering, but there will forever be a missing day on the blog. Oh well. </p>

<p>On the plus side, I did get a lot of editing done yesterday and today. 'Jeffries' is coming along, but I still have a lot of work to do on the last 1/3 or so of the story. I'm still think about how to rework it. I can't give an ETA at this time, but I'll be working on it as steadily as I can. </p>

<p>I have yet to hear back from any of the publications I've submitted to in the last couple of months or so. Kinda worrying, but not wholly unusual. A lot of place take a long time to get back, but it is weird that I seemed to have submitted only to that kind of publisher lately. I look forward to hearing back about my poetry submissions especially. I hope they get back soon! I'm tired of waiting!</p>
