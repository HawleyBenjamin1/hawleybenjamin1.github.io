<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm almost finished with Oneiromancer's first draft (though it feels like I've almost been finished with it for the last two months). As I'm writing the end I'm already aware that it feels like the end just kind of happens, even though I as the writer know it was building up, if that makes any sense. I'm going to need to add a lot, and probably remove a lot, just to make it feel like it fits. This whole novel writing thing is hard. Why didn't anybody tell me that beforehand?</p>
