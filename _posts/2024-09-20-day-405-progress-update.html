<p>There's not much left to do in the story I've been working on 'Jeffries.' Originally that was a working title, but now I've come to like it so I think I'll keep it. There are only a few scenes left I need to work on. Editing shouldn't be too much work since most of it has come out pretty much how I wanted it to be. I think there are a few spots I can clean up to make it read smoother but the story is all there. </p>

<p>I've also polished up a poem I wrote a while back for the Margaret Reid poetry competition. The deadline is at the end of the month and I can submit up to three poems. I only have two that I want to send in, but I'll hold off on submitting for now. Maybe inspiration will strike in the next ten days or so and I can add in another. </p>

<p>Not much else to talk about. Got a couple of club meetings coming up and as always, a novel to work on. I'd better get back to it.</p>
