<p>I think this year I have more to be thankful for than any year on record. I get to wake up and do what I want to do with my day, every day, without any distractions. It's yielded some results already, but more importantly it feels like a great part of my life and I'm sure I'll look back and treasure it, no matter where it goes. </p>

<p>I hope everybody has something to be thankful for too and gets to spend some time eating way too much turkey today. Once again, Happy Thanksgiving!</p>
