<p>Not much to report today. I decided to start reading the Hemingway novel from my book haul next instead of Beloved because I actually haven't received Beloved yet. I ordered it online and the rest of my books arrived but that one hasn't come. I hope it didn't get lost in the mail, I'm kinda annoyed that I can't read it now. Hemingway will have to come first just so I can have something to read. I haven't gotten far enough into A Moveable Feast to have any impressions yet, but I'll probably have a first impressions post ready either Thursday or Friday. The first two pages are good though!</p>

<p>Today I'm just going to focus on Oneiromancer. When I started this whole thing I said I want to wrap it up by the end of August and I'm hoping I can stick to that. The date is coming up so it's all hands on deck. That being, two hands. For some reason it feels like I'm constantly stuck even though I've been making semi-steady progress most of the time. It's a weird limbo. I'll be happy when I have it finished.</p>
