<p>Well it's happened again. Thanksgiving has come around. After tomorrow, the veil will come down, and Christmas music will once again sweep the country like some kind of invasion from another dimension. Everywhere you go, from the coffee shops, to the grocery stores, it'll come pouring out in a sonic deluge. The very air will thrum with its power. At the same time as your ears, Mariah Carey's bank account will be flooded with Christmas cheer. Every year the date seems to creep closer. I've already heard Christmas music while out and about buying groceries even though Thanksgiving hasn't even happened yet. Soon it'll be starting before Halloween is even over, and by the year 2500 or so, they'll just be playing it year-round. All other forms of music will become blasphemy and the world will succumb to an endless Christmas holiday. </p>

<p>The only thing standing in the way of this nightmare is pumpkin themed seasonal coffee. Maybe if we can band together and celebrate Thanksgiving really, really hard tomorrow, everyone will realize there's more money to be made from other holidays too. Perhaps we could petition Mariah to sing a song about the other holidays. Something. Anything. I'm open to suggestions!</p>
