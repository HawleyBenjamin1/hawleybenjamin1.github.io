<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Not much to report today, but I am starting a new book, a collection of short stories by Anton Chekhov. He was a playwright and wrote four classic plays that made him famous, but I'm most interested in his short fiction that is also held in extremely high regard. I've read at least one of Chekhov's stories before for a literature class, but I can't recall the title to save my life. I'm sure I'll recognize it when I get to it. I'm excited to start reading and I'll have some thoughts about the collection before long I'm sure. </p>
