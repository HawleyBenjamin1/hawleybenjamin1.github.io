<p>I took a five-hour train ride across a couple of states today, and I spent most of it staring out the window. Watching the world go by just beyond the tracks always makes me feel a little small. All that stuff that slips right past and out of sight is only a little slice, but it's still way too much to process all at once. I see more out of a train window than I ever can while driving. Who knows what all goes on out there even in just the little time spent traveling. It's the kind of feeling I wish I could capture in my stories; the sense that there is something much larger just beyond sight, operating all by itself. Maybe I'll try to capture it tomorrow.</p>
