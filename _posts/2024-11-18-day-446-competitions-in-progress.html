<p>I was brainstorming for some projects I'm working on today and it struck me once again how much easier it is to come up with ideas than to execute on them well. It reminds me of the way a dream feels so real while you're in it, but seems ridiculous only moments after waking. Working on my craft is all about getting what's in my head down on paper in better and better ways. I've never read a writing book that discusses whether it'll actually work even if your writing is good enough though. </p>

<p>Anyway, I'm sticking to the accuracy by volume approach for these competitions I'm working on, so I'm bound to get one workable idea. They're all very short fiction, no more than 1,000 words, and very fun concepts. I'll let you guys know more as I finish them!</p>
