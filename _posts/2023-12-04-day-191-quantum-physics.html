<p>Quantum physics is one of those weird rabbit holes I fall down every so often just because it is too interesting to ignore. I don't even understand normal physics, but thankfully a lot of great content creators have made dozens if not hundreds of well thought out videos on this topic, making it much easier to wrap your head around some of the famous experiments in the field. This MinutePhysics video for example makes Bell inequalities easy to understand, but of course truly wrapping your head around it is just about impossible.</p>

<p>The reason I found myself looking into this incredibly confusing (and frankly nonsensical) topic is because I found a great competition I'm going to enter based around the topic of quantum mechanics. <a href="https://shorts.quantumlah.org/news/one-last-call-quantum-inspired-flash-fiction">You can check it out right here if you're interested.</a> No entry fee, 1000 word limit, really neat topic, and a top prize of $1500 with a chance for awards even if you don't win? Sign me up. The only drawback is you have to include the phrase 'nobody said this was going to be easy,' which admittedly does fit well with the topic. </p>

<p>I'll probably be thinking about these silly wave functions for the next week and a half while I write this story, so maybe I'll make another post about quantum physics sometime soon.</p>
