<p>Something rare happened today that always feels good. I sat down, had an idea, wrote the whole short story, and even feel pretty good about it. All that's left is to find a place to submit it. Though, I guess it would be smart to let it sit for a few days then edit first ... I wonder if I'll ever be able to just write something and have it be great from the second it hits the page? Wouldn't that be nice.</p>
