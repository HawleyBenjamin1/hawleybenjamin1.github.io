<p>Good morning everyone, thought I'd do an early post today because it's my birthday! And wouldn't you know it, my copy of the anthology I was published in just arrived too. Not to shamelessly use my birthday against you or anything, but you can check it out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stories-That-Need-Told-2023/dp/1962812804/ref=sr_1_1?crid=228JDZWUKCJB4&amp;keywords=stories+that+need+to+be+told&amp;qid=1699020167&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=stories+that+need+to+be+tol%2Cstripbooks%2C89&amp;sr=1-1">'Stories that Need to be Told 2023' right here</a>, and it would be much appreciated if you could show the publishers some love. </p>

<p>There are some great stories in this 2023 edition. I'm particularly enthralled by the grand prize winner 'Gerald: A Memoir' by Arlo Z Graves. If you do end up buying it, let me know how it was in the comments!</p>
