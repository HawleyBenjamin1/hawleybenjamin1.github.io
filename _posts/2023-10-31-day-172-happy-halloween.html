<p>I don't usually do much for Halloween, but I do love to see spooky things going on, costumes, decorations, that kind of thing. I think tonight I'm going to watch a horror movie, or maybe try to find some horror stories to read. Every once in a while I'll try to write some horror but it never quite comes out the way I want it, probably because I don't read enough horror to really get it. Maybe if I take some time to really dig into it this Halloween I'll figure something out. </p>
