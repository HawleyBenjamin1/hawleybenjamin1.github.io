<p>Watching the fallout adaptation over the weekend was a lot of fun. It's been a while since I've seen a video game adaptation that didn't completely suck. In fact, I can't even think of one while writing this. Before watching the show I decided to finally give one of the games a try, seeing as I had never been able to get into them before. I ended up playing through 'Fallout New Vegas' to get a good sense of the games, and man. They did such a good job of exploring the world established in the games, really nailing that same atmosphere of desolation tempered by the humor that results from the wacky depravity that so many of the wasteland denizens carry with them. I was hooked from start to end and I think it's probably the most earnest and creative adaptation of a video game I've ever seen.</p>

<p>Lucy was a great way to characterize a vault dweller because she reflects so many of the players who slowly adapt to the wasteland as the game goes on. At the start of the game I thought I might be able to bring some sanity to the world, but by the third or fourth hour (and stepping on the nth improvised landmine) I started to really question whether I should keep applying the golden rule to these people. There are some really messed up factions in the world, and even more messed up individuals, but just a few good people were all it took to keep my faith in humanity alive. Going through the wasteland and seeing all this depraved crap made the few honorable people really shine, just like they do in the show. </p>

<p>The balance between storylines was something I thought the show did better than any videogame could. Seeing Norm's story in the vault progress in parallel with Lucy's wasteland adventure was really quite something. I think I could learn a thing or two about parallel plotlines from the writers of the show. Every beat that Lucy hit had its reflection in Norm. The same could be said for the Ghoul's story, with the way Lucy tries to introduce some humanity to his character while at the same time his old self loses his own. Maximus had his moments too, although I didn't think his story was quite as complex or compelling. That said, I guess a more straightforward damsel in distress motivation is a perfect fit for someone in the Brotherhood. I do wish he had been just a little bit of a deeper thinker though. Watching him get the crap kicked out of him just because he left his armor unattended in the wasteland had me smacking my forehead. Not that the others didn't make their own poor decisions, but his were pretty egregious. </p>

<p>All the little nods to the video games really sealed the deal for me though. From the Ghoul's wasteland rule of 'Thou shalt get sidetracked by some bullshit every damn time,' to Norm's hacking scene that took the computer screen directly from the games, it really felt like the people working on the show had actually played and enjoyed the games. That's not something I can say for all adaptations, videogame adaptations or otherwise. </p>

<p>All in all this show was a breath of fresh air. It was hopeful in a time when so many movies, books, and other shows are hopeless. It found humor and humanity in even the most dreadful of places and the most inhuman of people. The fine line between doing what you must and retaining the values that make you who you are was such a great theme to see explored so well and I'm glad I got to watch it. I highly recommend this, and I'm especially proud to say it's actually even better if you've played the games, rather than it being something enjoyed only as a separate entity. </p>
