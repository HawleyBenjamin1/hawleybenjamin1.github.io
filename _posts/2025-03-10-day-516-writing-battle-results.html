<p>Over the weekend I finally got the results back from the writing battle I joined over a month ago. Long story short, I made top 16! It was my first battle and I'm happy to have gotten so far on a story that I enjoyed working on so much. Now that the competition is over, I decided to make the story public so anybody can read it on the website. <a href="https://www.writingbattle.com/story/debrief/31955646-9785-40c5-841f-00058f81ad10?uploadedStory">If you're interested, check it out right here!</a></p>

<p>The feedback I got from the judges was largely positive and I'm happy with what I've got. They brought up a few points where they were a little confused or thrown by my word choice, but there was nothing critically wrong with the story, so I'll take that as a big win. </p>

<p>The whole experience has been the most fun I've had with a writing competition. The format of receiving round by round results and getting feedback from fellow participants makes it so much more engaging than all the other 'fire and forget' competitions I've joined. I hope the Writing Battles site continues to grow and prosper into the future.</p>
