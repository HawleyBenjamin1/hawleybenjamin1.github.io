<p>Well I got a lot done over the weekend, submitted for two competitions, edited some of Oneiromancer, got some pieces in place for the next steps. I'm not sure what else to say other than things are going smoothly. Other than the fact that I have nothing better to talk about on my blog today that is. </p>

<p>This week I want to try covering a few more literary topics, writing stuff that I want to investigate. I was reviewing my earlier blog posts and noticed that I wrote plenty about that sort of thing, but it's tapered off since then. The issue is, there's only so much writing you can do about writing before you want to just go write. There's probably too much to cover in one lifetime, but I'll do my best to investigate the ins and outs of the following topics this week, starting tomorrow:</p>

<p>I want to start with character building and how I like to approach it, then story archetypes and the ones I like, and something that's been waiting for a long time is how a magic system can be built. That one I think has been covered so many times on the internet that there's not much I can add, but that's not the point! I'm just writing about these things so I can learn about them myself, not because I'm a supreme expert or anything.</p>
