<p>Sorry for the late post today everyone, took me a long time to finish up my other work. I used to use the blog as a warm up but lately I've been putting it off more and more, and this episode with my hand isn't helping things. </p>

<p>Anyway, very slow progress today, mostly pecking words out one letter at a time. It's an interesting, albeit incredibly tedious experience. I think I may just write this week off as a loss and do nothing until my hand heals. Right now I'm typing this on my phone with one hand and it's a mess. Earlier I had some ideas I wanted to get down and I even reported to *gasp* pen and paper. I know, I know. What am I, some kind of Luddite? Well, I guess gel pens are pretty modern all things considered, so compared to my ancestors I'm using some advanced tech, but still. For a writer, I don't like writing with a pen much, never have. Can't wait till I can type pain free again. </p>
