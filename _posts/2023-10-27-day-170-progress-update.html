<p>Made decent progress this week on Oneiromancer, but I also took the time to write some other stuff. I've found that if I focus too hard on one thing I just fail to write enough to keep the habit up. Seems weird but I actually get more done on the main project when I write side projects at the same time. Keeps the juices flowing I guess. I got another chapter done, started a new chapter, and it's coming along as well. Fingers crossed I can keep the ball rolling. </p>

<p>I'm going to start querying for some of my other projects soon when they come to completion. It's been quite a while since I sent anything out for publication, mostly because I just didn't have anything complete. I have a couple of short stories that have been sitting a while and I'm going to edit those up. I also have a poem I can send out so hopefully I get some good responses from this next round of querying. </p>

<p>All in all, making decent progress.</p>
