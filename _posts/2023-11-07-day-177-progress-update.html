<p>Not much to report today. I had a slow weekend and wasn't able to get much done, but I was able to reintroduce some old scenes I wrote that hadn't found a place in the story yet. In some ways I added more to the story in a few minutes than I have in hours of typing. In other ways I did next to nothing. Weird how that works out sometimes.</p>

<p>I think I'm pretty close to wrapping it up. I've said that before though ... My goal was always to edit over the course of fall, which obviously is impossible, so the new goal is just to finish before December comes around. I think I can really get there this time. Fingers crossed anyway. It'd be nice to have a good copy that I can use for querying by the time a year comes around. It's been over eight months since I quit my job to try and live a little, so if I can say I got all the writing done I could in a year and finished up a novel, that'd be awesome. I recently doubled the word count I started with back in March. Those first 60 thousand words took almost two years, and here I've done an equal amount, plus editing, plus the blog, plus all the short stories and everything else since I started taking it seriously. I may not have a novel in my hands yet, but at least I can say I've made some decent progress.</p>
