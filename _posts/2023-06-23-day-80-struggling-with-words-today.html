<p>Well it's Friday again, and my brain does not want to do any work today. My word count is probably going to end up laughably low unless I can pull a rabbit out of my hat and find some creative juices to pull on. Usually I can get some good progress going between 10AM and 1PM, but today it was just not happening. I don't know why, but some days the words just do not flow very well. I wonder if it's possible to predict this sort of thing before it happens? Maybe if I could do that, I could avoid it in the first place. It's so annoying to be making such good progress one day only to peter out the next for seemingly no reason. Anyway, I'm going to try to at least hit a word goal for today and then regroup to try again tomorrow. Have a wonderful Friday!</p>
