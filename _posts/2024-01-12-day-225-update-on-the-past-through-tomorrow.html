<p>Something I noticed while reading Heinlein after Epstein's book on novels is that Heinlein is a very idea focused writer. So far every character has been a flat person, more of a vehicle for the plot than a real human being. I'm hoping that will change as the stories get longer. I guess I'll find out once I get to the novel, <em>Methuselah's Children</em>. Until then, I'm not sure how he'll be able to introduce much character development into stories so focused on the concepts they present. Maybe he can san surprise me. </p>
