<p>And I actually won! I got published in the Book of Choices anthology, which you will eventually be able to find on <a href="https://wolfgrove.media/">this website</a>, but I don't think they've made an update yet. Hopefully I'm not stealing any of their thunder here, although I doubt they would care if more people see their stuff. I'll make another update once it's actually available.</p>

<p>So excited to get my hands on it and read everybody else's stories!</p>
