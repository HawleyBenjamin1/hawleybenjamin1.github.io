<p>Well, I'm stuck. I don't particularly like the ending of 'Jeffries,' but I can't come up with any alternates I would ever change it to. There are a few problems that are really driving me nuts. First of all, the main villain is very monologue-y. It was always part of his character, but it needs to be shortened because it really cuts into Jeffry's agency, not to mention the reader's patience. I think I can fix it, but the other big problem is a harder fix. I'm not sure how to get all the payoff I want for all the questions I posed without a big fat dump of information at the end that reads terribly. The monologuing I can fix by cutting large chunks. The other problem I think I'd just have to rewrite in order to fix, but I like I already said, I don't know what to rewrite to! So frustrating. Not that I'm complaining or anything ... I mean at least I have the bones looking alright. </p>
