<p>Progress marches on. I've submitted for the Tom Howard/Margaret Reid competition, and I should hear back within the next few months. There's a recurring short story competition I'd like to enter from GlobeSoup, one of my favorite publishers who constantly puts out new opportunities. The challenge with this one is that I'll have to have my submission ready in the next week! I think I'll just have to brush up an old story if I want to get that one ready in time.</p>

<p>I should have a report on 'Jane Eyre' by the end of the week. It's good, and I never know quite where it's going next. Bronte is good at keeping me on my toes. I'm excited to read the next book though. Its like looking being in a museum and viewing a painting by a master painter that you just know is great, but you'd rather move on to the next painting now. </p>

<p>Not much else to report. Hope everyone has a good Hump Day!</p>
