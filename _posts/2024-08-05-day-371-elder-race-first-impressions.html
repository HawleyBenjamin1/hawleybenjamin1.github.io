<p>Ok, I have a confession to make. This is not quite my usual 'first impressions' post. This time I've read the whole story and already have the full impression of it, but I wanted to make this post to give people a chance to read it first without any spoilers. It's really important that this book be given a chance to stand all on it's own. </p>

<p>Adrian Tchaikovsky's 'Elder Race' is a short novel that's not quite like any other I've read. It's a unique blend of sci-fi and fantasy created with such a deft hand that it was hard not to love. It being so short, I read it over the course of a few hours, but packed into that small package is a great story set in an expansive world. It was absolutely worth the $3.99 I paid for it. I'd highly recommend that you go into this one blind like I did. Any expectations I set here could totally ruin the fun, especially in the first few chapters. A large part of this book's power is how it can take you by surprise.</p>

<p>That said, I'm still going to make a future post about it where I discuss it in greater detail. Hopefully anybody who wants to read both 'Elder Race' and my blog will have read the book by then and won't have it ruined by hearing all about it. </p>
