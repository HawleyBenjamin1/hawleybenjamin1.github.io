<p>I realized on Saturday that I made an extra post by mistake. I also have two day 302 posts. Usually I correct the stupid mistakes I make on here but this time I'm just going to leave it. For posterity's sake.  </p>

<p>I had a good editing session this morning and I'm planning on keeping the trend going by doing an afternoon session too. Usually I edit for a while and then work on something else in the second session but I'd like to try and focus on the novel today. Something about today makes me feel good about it so I figure I'd better cash in while the feeling lasts. </p>

<p>This week I'm going to review the next book in the book haul, 'Making Shapely Fiction.' I started reading 'Writing Past Dark' but it was too similar in theme to the last book I read so I decided to put that one off for the more technical book instead. I'm interested to see what tips and tricks I can pull out of 'Making Shapely Fiction' because in the midst of editing I really need every advantage I can get. </p>

<p>Other than that, the only other thing I've worked on is honing a pitch letter I can use to query agents and publishers. Maybe I'll post it here for some feedback before sending it out.</p>
