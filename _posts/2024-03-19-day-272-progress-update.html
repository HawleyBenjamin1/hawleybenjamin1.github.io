<p>Editing is going a little smoother. I committed to just rewriting complete sections rather than trying to rework the existing material. That helped me in letting go of some of the issues present. Unfortunately it will be a lot of work. Hopefully certain sections are still ok. I have a few in mind that I really want to keep around. </p>

<p>I'll be hunting for a new theme for the next book haul soon. I'm thinking maybe I'll have a nonfiction haul this time around. I'd like to reread some of the books I have on writing as a craft so I may just roll with that. I'm interested in seeing how my perspective on these books has changed in the past year of dedicated writing. </p>

<p>Finally, I have a couple of short stories I'm going to post here. These never got any traction with publishers, so I'll go ahead and make them available here instead. I'll do one this week and one next week to space them out. Maybe I'll try to make this more of a regular thing in the future but for now it will just be the two of them.</p>
