<p>Late post because I just could not seem to get anything down today. I did a little line editing but as far as actually improving the story, not much got done. Last week I finished writing two short stories, and I'm going to edit those this weekend. Hopefully it goes pretty smoothly, editing Oneiromancer is getting tedious. A lot of the writing is really weak and I'm having to rewrite entire chapters from scratch to get some semblance of what I want to see. I think as long as I keep working at it it'll turn out ok.</p>
