<p>I realized while going to publish this post that I got ahead of myself yesterday and published it as day 33, so if you're confused about why it's day 33 twice in a row, it's because yesterday was day 32. I proofread these, I promise.</p>

<p>I started on my next book, A Tale of Two Cities. I'm already blown away. In the copy I have there is a page that lists out every character and gives a short synopsis of who they are, their personal traits, and the important ways that they relate to others before the novel even starts. This is so ingenious I can't believe I haven't seen it done before, though I'm certain somebody else must have too. I wish every book had this, and I think I need to go make one for my own work just to have it all written down. </p>

<p>Beyond that, the writing is (of course) superb, and I'm really enjoying it so far. Not much has happened yet, but I got to read the classic "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times" opening and it really sets the stage like nothing else. This copy also includes illustrations, another surprise for me. I looked it up, expecting to find these were added long after publication, but they were actually included in the magazine where the novel was originally published in 31 weekly entries. Naturally they're illustrated moments from the novel, and they really help me picture the scene. The clothes, the hair, the accessories, all stuff I was having trouble imagining because I don't live in the mid 1800s. Now I know what everybody looks like thanks to the illustrator, Hablot Knight Browne. If every old book had pictures of who was being described, maybe classics would be easier to get into. They certainly would be for me anyway.</p>

<p>I'm excited to keep reading this one and I sincerely hope it lives up to the hundred and fifty years worth of hype behind it. No pressure Dickens. </p>
