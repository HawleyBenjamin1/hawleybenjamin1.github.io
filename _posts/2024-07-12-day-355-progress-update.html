<p>I'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel for this first editing pass. I have another hundred pages to go, and then I can start all over again with what I learned this time. I'm not sure how many passes it will take total, but I'm guessing at least two more. This is a really grueling line of work. </p>

<p>Hopefully this first pass will leave it in decent enough shape for me to get some traction with a publisher though. I don't want to tackle another editing pass without some help. It feels like I could easily get the wrong idea about the quality of one part or another and get stuck editing myself into a great big hole. I'll probably focus on the first fifty pages or so, since that's what most publishers use when looking through queries, then if I get an editor to help me I can figure out the rest. And with that, I think my plan is finalized. I've been on such a roll I think I can get this editing pass done by the end of the month and start querying for an agent. At least, if the roll keeps on rolling anyway. I'm excited to move on to the next step.</p>
