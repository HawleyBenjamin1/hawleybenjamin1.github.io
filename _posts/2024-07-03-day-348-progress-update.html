<p>I'm almost 200 pages in to my first editing pass. The whole book was about 300 pages when I started, but has since grown by about 20 pages after I filled in some parts I left open during the first draft. Still, feels good to be about 2/3 of the way through, even if I still think the hardest part is ahead of me. I think I can push through to the end of this edit by mid August if I keep the same pace. After that I think it will need a professional to take a look and let me know if I've got anything worth publishing. Hopefully someone will take enough of an interest to help me get it into a better shape than I can on my own. </p>
