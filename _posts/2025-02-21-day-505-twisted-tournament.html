<p>The <a href="https://twistedtournament.com/">Twisted Tournament</a> I'm competing in is down to the wire. I have just under 22 hours left to write a 100 word story. I won't post the prompts here because it may interfere with the judges' decision if they happen to find the blog, but just know that they're some killer prompts! Well, for a long story they would be. But with only 100 words I don't know if I can turn it into anything. All the reroll options look really interesting too, and I'm frozen with indecision!</p>

<p>Ok, it's not that bad. I'm just gonna use the prompts I have because they're really good and hope I can squish an idea down into 100 words. It's really almost nothing! The paragraph above is 89 words. I only get one more sentence than that. Wish me luck!</p>
