<p>I removed a big section of 'Jeffries' today and couldn't help but remember that old saying. I think the story is better off for it, but there's a lot of missing information that I'll have to find more creative ways to slip in now. It made me wonder if killing your darlings was always meant to be purely about excising unnecessary pieces of a novel, or if it has some deeper meaning. The fact that I'll have to creatively repurpose my darlings in order to get the same information across gives me some inspiration to continue working. Maybe that was always what the intention was.</p>
