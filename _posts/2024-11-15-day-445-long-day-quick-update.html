<p>I've found several competitions, lined them all up, and am planning on writing stories for them in the next month or so. Sorry for the short post, but I was doing research and almost forgot. I did get 'The Cuckoo's Calling' back though, and I will try to have a review out on Monday, but this weekend might be kinda busy for me. At this point I just want to finish it and move on honestly. I'm too invested and stubborn to give it up without getting to the end. Strike better figure this mystery out, and fast!</p>
