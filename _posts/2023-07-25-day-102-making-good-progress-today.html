<p>I'm making some great progress today and I really want to capitalize on the flow I've got going so this blog is going to be a short one. Sometimes I wish my brain were a computer so I could reliably do this all the time. If every day were like this, I'm sure the novel would be done by now. As it stands, I have a squishy, organic, analog thing that likes to think it can be consistent instead. I guess the trade off is that I can fit my brain in my skull instead of a server mount, react to bodily threats in milliseconds, imagine fake scenarios in my head on demand, and do all of that on less than 2000 calories a day. My PC runs on a 500 watt power supply unit, but probably only uses about 250-350 watts of that at any given moment. It usually runs about 4-6 hours a day between writing, gaming, surfing the internet, and listening to music. Do the math, and that averages to over 1.2 <em><span style="text-decoration: underline">million</span></em> calories per day based on 1 Watt = 859.85 calories per hour. The energy efficiency of organic processors is mind boggling. </p>
