<p>It's said that James Joyce only averaged about 90 words a day based on the eight years it took him to write the 265,000 words in 'Ulysses.' Naturally this gives writers everywhere either a confidence boost or a convenient excuse, depending on how well they've been doing lately. Given the timing of this post, which is supposed to be a daily exercise to keep me going, I'll let you figure out which it is for me today. </p>
