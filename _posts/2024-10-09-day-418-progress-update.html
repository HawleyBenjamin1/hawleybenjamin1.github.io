<p>This update will be a short one because I haven't made very much progress at all. It's pretty frustrating to get stuck on a story like I have with 'Jeffries,' and I'm not sure how to even avoid this trap. It feels like every time there's a story I really want to tell, it takes me months to get it out just the way I want. I know I should just write it, see how it turns out, and go from there, but man. It's so hard to do that. </p>

<p>I have gotten plenty of reading done though. My last book haul is going swimmingly. I've started on 'What the River Buries,' and should have a good first impressions post out by the end of the week. I think by the end of the year I will have read more books than I have in at least a decade. The last time I read this much was when I was rewarded points for every book I got through in elementary school. I think I deserve some points now too, children shouldn't get all the made up rewards to themselves. In fact, that might even be a fun website if it doesn't exist already. Assign a bunch of books point values and start a leaderboard, maybe send out small gifts to the winners. Who knows? It could be the next Facebook.</p>

<p>Well, that's about all I've got. I sent out some old stories to various magazines a while back but none of them were accepted for anything yet. Much ado about nothing. It gets harder and harder to send them out the more I write because the more I learn, the less interesting my old stories seem to be. I'd probably have to overhaul them to get them any good, but I just don't have the desire to do so. I'll just put my efforts into my current projects instead. Hopefully by the next update I'll have produced more exciting results.</p>
