My name is Ben and I have this crazy dream of writing stuff and living off of it. I’ve always been an avid reader, from sci-fi to lit fic, magazines and blogs, even a bit of romance here and there. My love of the written word has gotten me through thick and thin. It also planted an obsession with dreaming up new worlds and characters and stories, ideas that flourish whether I want them to or not. Putting pen to paper is a different thing entirely though. It took a rather adamant college professor making me share my stories to show me that it wasn’t as scary as I thought it would be to turn those ideas into reality and let people see them.

Thing is, it takes a lot of sacrifice to get that out there. I had to completely change careers from a more than viable path to be in a place to start this project. If I fail, that’s it. I’ve gotta go back to the ol’ grind instead of the industry I’d really like to be in. It’s a real shame that many may never get the chance to do what I’m trying to do here, and I know it could go belly up so easily. Which is why I’ve named the blog as it is, the Dangerous Day Job.

If you’ve always had a dream like me, or if you’re one of the many billions who can’t just drop everything to do what you want deep down, then you can follow my dream, right here, until you’re ready to follow your own. So here I go, taking on my new and Dangerous Day Job.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
