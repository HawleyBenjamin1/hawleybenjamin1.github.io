I think it might be up there with the strangest books I've ever read, but that's not a bad thing in this case. Author Greg Egan leaned into strangeness of his brand of hard sci-fi with elements of body and biological horror. Its chock full of these disturbing scenes where something wholly bizarre will happen as a consequence of the brilliant conceptual basis. 'Morphotrophic' is set in a world where cells can emigrate at will to other organisms, and even change form based on subtle electrical signals. This one rule results in many otherworldly happenings that often feel all too realistic. Scientists diving deep into cell morphotype research unlock the ability to trigger new morphotypes to form from existing cells, swappers exchange their body parts with other human beings to get the best combinations, and mind-bending experiments reveal new biological truths.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I think this book starts off extremely strong with just how weird it is. Its hard not to want to read more when the characters are shedding cells and bathing in ground-up pig to get them back in the very first chapter. The prose can get a little bland as the world building aspects extend their welcome at times, but with such a complex basis, I have to forgive Egan for a lot of the exposition that would normally put me off. The science here is so different that it almost feels like fantasy, although I can't claim it ever broke its own logic, just that the logic was so far reaching it was hard to keep up. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Unfortunately, I didn't find any of the characters especially relatable. I think that put a damper on my enjoyment of what would otherwise have been a top-ten book for me. It was just that the plot inflicted itself on so many of them, even the most powerful characters, that I often felt like everyone and everything was at the mercy of something random happening and derailing any plans that anybody had made. I haven't mentioned many plot specifics because honestly its just too hard to summarize it. There are like five main characters and a long series of flashbacks. The antagonists are mysterious and vague, and among all the other highbrow conceptual stuff its easy to get lost. I also noticed that some of the characters had weirdly calm reactions to very strange things happening, strange even for the characters living in the strange world. This only happened once or twice, its really more of a nitpick, but it pulled me out of things when people started spawning new organisms without much of an internal or external reaction. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Overall, this book has a really strong central pillar that helps it stand out among the crowd, but I had some difficulties along the way too. I'll have to read some more of Egan's works to see how I really feel about his style as a whole.

It's a thought provoking story in more ways than one, and not at all what I was expecting. I like having my expectations defied, especially when a story goes above and beyond, but I'm not sure how I feel about it overall. I'll give a quick synopsis first.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The story feels as ephemeral as the mind of the machine intelligence that pervades Maddie's life throughout, and most of it takes place from just one little room. First it immediately resolves a cliff hanger from the second story by introducing Mist, Maddie's cloud-born sister. She is a child of David, and possibly many others, who has inherited their traits, including David's love of Maddie and Ellen. The structure of the story is built around Maddie getting to know Mist as they strive to keep a new threat from rising.

It's a thought provoking story in more ways than one, and not at all what I was expecting. I like having my expectations defied, especially when a story goes above and beyond, but I'm not sure how I feel about it overall. I'll give a quick synopsis first. The story feels as ephemeral as the mind of the machine intelligence that pervades Maddie's life throughout, and most of it takes place from just one little room. First it immediately resolves a cliff hanger from the second story by introducing Mist, Maddie's cloud-born sister. She is a child of David, and possibly many others, who has inherited their traits, including David's love of Maddie and Ellen. The structure of the story is built around Maddie getting to know Mist as they strive to keep a new threat from rising. After burying the last vestiges of David, Mist informs Maddie that a new company called Everlasting has been scouring what networks remain after the world wars have cooled, searching for pieces of the old gods that brought civilization to its knees. Its obvious that the mysterious CEO, Adam Ever, is trying to piece together a new way to upload people's minds to the cloud. Their systems are bulletproof too. Mist can't seem to hack her way in to stop them but she does get ahold of all the scraps of code they've compiled and sends them to Maddie. Maddie, meanwhile, studies the scraps and tries to piece together what it was that made the gods turn on the world they left behind. Again, all this takes place from one room.

I could not put this book down. It is an action-packed little thriller with a deeply immersive narrator and a ton of juicy sci-fi elements. In other words, everything I love to see in a story. There's not too much to this book since it is a novella, but it held my attention well enough to keep me reading straight through to the end in a single sitting. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The narrator is Murderbot, a partially organic security robot that has been rented to a team of surveyors investigating an alien planet. For a guy designed to shoot and get shot at and not much else, he has a surprising amount of heart. He became a rogue unit after hacking into the governor in his head that would usually force him to follow company protocols to the letter. This gives him a huge degree of freedom compared to his chilly counterparts. Naturally, as a guy who works a boring security job for a living, he spends a lot of his free time watching hundreds of hours worth of soap operas from the entertainment stream coming in from a company satellite whenever he has a little downtime. He's relatable in a depressingly funny way, poking fun at the corporate robots that already exist in our society. He grows a lot over the course of the story, and provides a strong backbone for the reader to experience the plot.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>When the survey team Murderbot is assigned to protect realizes that another company on the other side of the planet has gone dark, they can't help but go investigate. An accident in the intro of the novel wherein Murderbot saves a few members of the survey team has already tipped them off that this is not your usual security bot. The prospect of being discovered terrifies him however. If they realize that he's a rogue unit and report that back to the company, he may be decommissioned, or worse, turned into a laboratory experiment. Surprisingly, the humans don't seem to be entirely unsympathetic to this emotional machine though. This adds a great layer of suspense that carries the plot through in the slow moments, and heightens the tension in the tense combat scenes where Murderbot has to trust his allies. And yes, as it turns out, Murderbot has to do some murdering to protect his new favorite humans from the competition. The planet has a secret that another survey team does not want getting out, and they'll use any means necessary to keep that secret for themselves. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I thought the characters fell a little flat though. In fact, I barely remember their names. They serve a useful plot purpose in that Murderbot comes to enjoy their company and that gives him something to strive towards, but other than that, I didn't get any sense of character progression from them at all. The antagonists are even thinner. They kinda just have a half-assed plan to take the planet for themselves, and that's really it. The star of the show is certainly the titular character. It gets away with it because of how fun it is to be in Murderbot's head, but I still have to call em' like I see em'. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Thankfully, he carried my interest as hard as he carried the survey team on his back. He's got some really cool features like his regenerating organic parts, the feed in his head that lets him connect to all kinds of different computer systems, and his integrated weapons and reconnaissance systems that pop up time and again throughout the story. His backstory is pretty cool too, and there's a lot of room for growth in a (painfully) relatable way. He's socially stunted, but also weirdly charming at times too. I would love to read the rest of this series sometime just to see how Murderbot progresses as he gains more and more freedom, and there's even a new show on Apple TV that just came out this month. If you do end up enjoying this character, there is plenty of good content surrounding him.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Despite its flaws, I thought this was a fun little read with a cool and compelling protagonist.

I'm excited to see where it goes though.
