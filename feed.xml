The histories behind the foods are always such great stories, and I like working similar little stories into my own worlds to add some authenticity. It's hard to beat the value that a recipe offers to connect people across continents and centuries. I noticed recently while reading the Green Bone Saga from Fonda Lee that she often uses little pieces of lore like recipes, commonly known stories, and even widespread company brands to create minor connections between characters. It creates this really convincing web of small commonalities between friends and enemies that all contribute to a sense of culture.

I'm sure to read some good stuff over the next couple of weeks! I'm hoping that as the rounds go on, the decisions will get harder and harder as I read better and better stories. In the end, it better be a real nail biter.
